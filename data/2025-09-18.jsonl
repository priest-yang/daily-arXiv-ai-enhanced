The objective is to minimize travel distance\nwhile maximizing the quality of cellular link connectivity by considering real\nworld aerial coverage constraints and employing an empirical aerial channel\nmodel. The proposed solution employs RL techniques to train an agent, using the\nquality of communication links between the UAV and base stations (BSs) as the\nreward function.

The RL algorithm efficiently identifies optimal\npaths, ensuring maximum connectivity with ground BSs to ensure safe and\nreliable BVLoS flight operation. Moreover, the solution can be deployed as an\noffline path planning module that can be integrated into future ground control\nsystems (GCS) for UAV operations, enhancing their capabilities and safety.

Without cross-institution transfer learning,\nperformance on the SF test was limited to an AUROC of 0.42 using SVM and 0.56\nusing BlueBERT. BlueBERT_TRANSFER, which was fine-tuned on both datasets,\nimproved the performance on SF test to AUROC 0.78. Performance of SVM, and\nBlueBERT_TRANSFER models on the manually curated Inst. reports (AUROC 0.85 and\n0.74) was similar to human performance (AUROC 0.81).\n  CONCLUSION: In summary, we successfully developed cross-institution NLP\nmodels on incident report text from radiation oncology centers.

Hence compressing 3DGS data is necessary for the cost\neffectiveness of 3DGS models. Recently, several anchor-based neural compression\nmethods have been proposed, achieving good 3DGS compression performance.\nHowever, they all rely on uniform scalar quantization (USQ) due to its\nsimplicity. A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can\nimprove the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead\nand minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with\nlattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific\ncharacteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's\nadaptability and R-D efficiency. This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a\nbalance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low\ncomplexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS\ncompression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal\nmodifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice\nbasis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single\nmodel to accommodate multiple bit rate targets.

However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby\nexposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we\nformalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder\nexisting approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation\nnamed AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the\n\"purification-customization\" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1)\nPatch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over\nhigh-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep\nGuidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different\ntimesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible\nperturbations that persist under representative purification settings,\nachieving effective post-customization distortion.

Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have\ndemonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we\nare the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two\nkey challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and\nanomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent\nbias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to\nsubtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects,\nrather than being distinguished as abnormal regions.

We then\ntrain and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks\nincluding classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a\ncomprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We\nalso discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective\nformat for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision\ntasks."}

Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy\nenhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to\nsubstantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain\ngaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to\naddress the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection\nfor BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with\ntheir multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric\nspaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain\nadaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware\nteacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a\nReliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model.\nSpecifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth\npredictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty\nestimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are\nessential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the\ndomain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric\nembedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two\ndomains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential\nMoving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts\ninformed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in\nfour cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D\nobject detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\\% NDS and 9.5\\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night\nadaptation."}

To\naddress this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid\ntoken-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning\nto enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core\nof STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible\nmerging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove\nhigh-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method\non high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to\n1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be\nreduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching\nscheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase\nin throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP\nframework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in\ncomputational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum\naccuracy drop of no more than 2.0%.

However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding."}
