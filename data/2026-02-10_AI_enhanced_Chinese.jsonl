Dey"], "title": "Scalable spatial point process models for forensic footwear analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Shoe print evidence recovered from crime scenes plays a key role in forensic investigations. By examining shoe prints, investigators can determine details of the footwear worn by suspects. However, establishing that a suspect's shoes match the make and model of a crime scene print may not be sufficient. Typically, thousands of shoes of the same size, make, and model are manufactured, any of which could be responsible for the print. Accordingly, a popular approach used by investigators is to examine the print for signs of ``accidentals,'' i.e., cuts, scrapes, and other features that accumulate on shoe soles after purchase due to wear. While some patterns of accidentals are common on certain types of shoes, others are highly distinctive, potentially distinguishing the suspect's shoe from all others. Quantifying the rarity of a pattern is thus essential to accurately measuring the strength of forensic evidence. In this study, we address this task by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our improvement over existing methods primarily stems from two advancements. First, we frame our approach in terms of a latent Gaussian model, thus enabling inference to be efficiently scaled to large collections of annotated shoe prints via integrated nested Laplace approximations. Second, we incorporate spatially varying coefficients to model the relationship between shoes' tread patterns and accidental locations. We demonstrate these improvements through superior performance on held-out data, which enhances accuracy and reliability in forensic shoe print analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c42\u7ea7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u978b\u5e95\u5076\u53d1\u6027\u78e8\u635f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7a00\u6709\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cd5\u533b\u978b\u5370\u8bc1\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6cd5\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u978b\u5370\u5339\u914d\u978b\u5b50\u7684\u54c1\u724c\u548c\u578b\u53f7\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u9501\u5b9a\u5acc\u7591\u4eba\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u978b\u5e95\u7531\u78e8\u635f\u7b49\u5076\u53d1\u56e0\u7d20\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5370\u8bb0\u7684\u7a00\u6709\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc1\u636e\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c42\u7ea7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5d4c\u5957\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u6807\u6ce8\u978b\u5370\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u7cfb\u6570\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u978b\u5e95\u82b1\u7eb9\u4e0e\u5076\u53d1\u5370\u8bb0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u6709\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u978b\u5370\u5f52\u5c5e\u5224\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u5c42\u7ea7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u7cfb\u6570\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5076\u53d1\u6027\u78e8\u635f\u5370\u8bb0\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u5f3a\u6cd5\u533b\u5b66\u4e2d\u978b\u5370\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Yet conventional supervised learning typically provides only class-level labels, allowing models to achieve high accuracy through shortcut correlations rather than the intended evidence. Human priors can help constrain such behavior, but aligning models to these priors remains challenging because learned representations often diverge from human perception. To address this challenge, we propose an attribution-based human prior alignment method. We encode human priors as input regions that the model is expected to rely on (e.g., bounding boxes), and leverage a highly faithful subset-selection-based attribution approach to expose the model's decision evidence during training. When the attribution region deviates substantially from the prior regions, we penalize reliance on off-prior evidence, encouraging the model to shift its attribution toward the intended regions. This is achieved through a training objective that imposes attribution constraints induced by the human prior. We validate our method on both image classification and click decision tasks in MLLM-based GUI agent models. Across conventional classification and autoregressive generation settings, human prior alignment consistently improves task accuracy while also enhancing the model's decision reasonability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u597d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0a\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u533a\u57df\u6307\u5bfc\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u636e\u975e\u5148\u9a8c\u533a\u57df\u65f6\u65bd\u52a0\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548cGUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c7b\u522b\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u901a\u8fc7\u4f9d\u8d56\u6377\u5f84\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u5fc5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u7406\u4f9d\u636e\u505a\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5929\u7136\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9075\u5faa\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5982bounding box\uff09\u5f62\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u636e\u3002\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u5f52\u56e0\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u533a\u57df\u504f\u79bb\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60e9\u7f5a\u63aa\u65bd\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u975e\u5148\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5f52\u56e0\u5411\u4eba\u7c7b\u671f\u671b\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u505a\u6cd5\u662f\u5728\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5f52\u56e0\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eGUI\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u70b9\u51fb\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5e38\u89c4\u5206\u7c7b\u8fd8\u662f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u5f52\u56e0\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e5f\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u65e2\u80fd\u505a\u5bf9\u4e5f\u80fd\u505a\u201c\u5bf9\u5f97\u5408\u7406\u201d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u6377\u5f84\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u4fe1\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Trained on over 200,000 fundus images, RetSAM supports three task categories and segments five anatomical structures, four retinal phenotypic patterns, and more than 20 distinct lesion types. It converts these segmentation results into over 30 standardized biomarkers that capture structural morphology, vascular geometry, and degenerative changes. Trained with a multi-stage strategy using both private and public fundus data, RetSAM achieves superior segmentation performance on 17 public datasets. It improves on prior best methods by 3.9 percentage points in DSC on average, with up to 15 percentage points on challenging multi-task benchmarks, and generalizes well across diverse populations, imaging devices, and clinical settings. The resulting biomarkers enable systematic correlation analyses across major ophthalmic diseases, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and pathologic myopia. Together, RetSAM transforms fundus images into standardized, interpretable quantitative phenotypes, enabling large-scale ophthalmic research and translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6RetSAM\uff0c\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u4ece\u773c\u5e95\u7167\u7247\u4e2d\u5206\u5272\u591a\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784/\u75c5\u7076\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u773c\u79d1\u53ca\u5168\u8eab\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u773c\u5e95\u5f71\u50cf\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u53ca\u3001\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u773c\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u8eab\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5f00\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u5272-\u91cf\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86RetSAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u572820\u4e07\u591a\u5f20\u773c\u5e95\u56fe\u7247\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e09\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u4e94\u79cd\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u56db\u79cd\u8868\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u4e8c\u5341\u4f59\u79cd\u75c5\u7076\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a30\u4f59\u79cd\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u773c\u79d1\u548c\u5168\u8eab\u75be\u75c5\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "RetSAM\u572817\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53473.9\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u70b9\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534715\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u826f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u751f\u6210\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u53ef\u5173\u8054\u591a\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u773c\u79d1\u75be\u75c5\u3002", "conclusion": "RetSAM\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u773c\u5e95\u7167\u7247\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u6027\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u773c\u79d1\u4e0e\u5168\u8eab\u75be\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

In flexible manufacturing, industrial embodied intelligence faces three core challenges: accurate process modeling and monitoring under limited perception, dynamic balancing between flexible adaptation and high-precision control, and the integration of general-purpose skills with specialized industrial operations. Accordingly, this survey reviews existing work from three viewpoints: Industrial Eye, Industrial Hand, and Industrial Brain. At the perception level (Industrial Eye), multimodal data fusion and real-time modeling in complex dynamic settings are examined. At the control level (Industrial Hand), flexible, adaptive, and precise manipulation for complex manufacturing processes is analyzed. At the decision level (Industrial Brain), intelligent optimization methods for process planning and line scheduling are summarized. By considering multi-level collaboration and interdisciplinary integration, this work reveals the key technological pathways of embodied intelligence for closed-loop optimization of perception-decision-execution in manufacturing systems. A three-stage evolution model for the development of embodied intelligence in flexible manufacturing scenarios, comprising cognition enhancement, skill transition, and system evolution, is proposed, and future development trends are examined, to offer both a theoretical framework and practical guidance for the interdisciplinary advancement of industrial embodied intelligence in the context of flexible manufacturing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u5236\u9020\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4ece\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u53d1\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u672a\u6765\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7075\u6d3b\u5236\u9020\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5de5\u4e1a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u611f\u77e5\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u67d4\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e4b\u773c\u201d\uff08\u611f\u77e5\uff09\u3001\u201c\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e4b\u624b\u201d\uff08\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u3001\u201c\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e4b\u8111\u201d\uff08\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u67d4\u6027\u7cbe\u5bc6\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u534f\u540c\u4e0e\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u878d\u5408\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5236\u9020\u9886\u57df\u5df2\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u611f\u77e5-\u51b3\u7b56-\u6267\u884c\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u5316\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u5236\u9020\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\u7ebf\u8def\u53ca\u6f14\u8fdb\u8109\u7edc\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u521b\u65b0\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

We investigate a fundamental question, does visual rendering truly decouple a model from tokenization constraints? Focusing on four Indonesian low-resource local languages that have their own non-Latin scripts (i.e., Javanese, Balinese, Sundanese, and Lampungnese), we evaluate the impact of script-tokenizer alignment within the DualGPT architecture. Our results show that, despite visual rendering, reintegrating a text tokenizer into the architecture reintroduces the same issue that pixel-based language modeling aims to resolve, which is the tokenizer misalignment problem. Despite having lower OOV and fertility rates, we show that the Llama 2 tokenizer performs significantly worse than a custom tokenizer, with improvements of up to 30.15 chrF++.

Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and various VLMs demonstrate that CR-VLM achieves effective, efficient, and robust configurable refusals, offering a scalable path toward user-adaptive safety alignment in VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CR-VLM\uff08\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u62d2\u7edd\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VLM\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5185\u5bb9\u62d2\u7edd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u9879\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u62d2\u7edd\u8fc7\u591a\u6216\u8fc7\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86CR-VLM\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a(1)\u5229\u7528teacher-forced\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u62d2\u7edd\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b(2)\u5f15\u5165\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u5408\u6cd5\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62d2\u7edd\uff1b(3)\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u62d2\u7edd\u8981\u6c42\u66f4\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e0d\u540cVLM\uff0c\u8868\u660eCR-VLM\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CR-VLM\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347VLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765VLM\u7684\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning, their potential for coordinated control has not been fully explored. Inspired by human teamwork, we present CLiMRS (Cooperative Large-Language-Model-Driven Heterogeneous Multi-Robot System), an adaptive group negotiation framework among LLMs for multi-robot collaboration. This framework pairs each robot with an LLM agent and dynamically forms subgroups through a general proposal planner. Within each subgroup, a subgroup manager leads perception-driven multi-LLM discussions to get commands for actions. Feedback is provided by both robot execution outcomes and environment changes. This grouping-planning-execution-feedback loop enables efficient planning and robust execution. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CLiMBench, a heterogeneous multi-robot benchmark of challenging assembly tasks. Our experiments show that CLiMRS surpasses the best baseline, achieving over 40% higher efficiency on complex tasks without sacrificing success on simpler ones. Overall, our results demonstrate that leveraging human-inspired group formation and negotiation principles significantly enhances the efficiency of heterogeneous multi-robot collaboration.

Vectra comprises three components: (1) Vectra Score, a multidimensional quality metric system that decomposes visual quality into 14 interpretable dimensions, with spatially-aware Defect Area Ratio (DAR) quantification to reduce annotation ambiguity; (2) Vectra Dataset, constructed from 1.1M real-world product images via diversity-aware sampling, comprising a 2K benchmark for system evaluation, 30K reasoning-based annotations for instruction tuning, and 3.5K expert-labeled preferences for alignment and evaluation; and (3) Vectra Model, a 4B-parameter MLLM that generates both quantitative scores and diagnostic reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Vectra achieves state-of-the-art correlation with human rankings, and our model outperforms leading MLLMs, including GPT-5 and Gemini-3, in scoring performance. The dataset and model will be released upon acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Vectra\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u8de8\u5883\u7535\u5546\u5546\u54c1\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u3001\u591a\u7ef4\u89e3\u91ca\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u540e\u5448\u73b0\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9488\u5bf9\u8de8\u5883\u7535\u5546\u56fe\u7247\u7ffb\u8bd1\uff08IIMT\uff09\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6587\u672c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u56fe\u7247\u89c6\u89c9\u5448\u73b0\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u9677\u548c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u5b98\u6cd5\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u3001\u5177\u4f53\u4e8e\u7535\u5546\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faVectra\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09Vectra Score\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7ec6\u5206\u4e3a14\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684Defect Area Ratio\uff08DAR\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u6b67\u4e49\uff1b2\uff09Vectra Dataset\uff0c\u542b110\u4e07\u5546\u54c1\u56fe\u7247\uff0c\u5305\u542b2K\u57fa\u51c6\u96c6\u30013\u4e07\u63a8\u7406\u6807\u6ce8\u4ee5\u53ca3,500\u4e13\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\uff1b3\uff09Vectra Model\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a40\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u5b9a\u91cf\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u8bca\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cVectra\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f97\u5206\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6392\u540d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fbe\u5230\u4e1a\u754c\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6253\u5206\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5305\u62ecGPT-5\u548cGemini-3\u7b49\u5934\u90e8\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Vectra\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u7535\u5546\u56fe\u7247\u7ffb\u8bd1\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u5f00\u653e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u4e1a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

At its core is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) that learns the complex mapping from image features to map coordinates, producing sparse but highly reliable global pose anchors. These anchors are fused into a bundle adjustment framework, effectively canceling drift while retaining local motion precision. KANLoc delivers three key advances: (i) a KAN-based pose regressor that achieves high accuracy with remarkable parameter efficiency, (ii) a hybrid VO-absolute localization scheme that yields globally consistent real-time trajectories (>=15 FPS), and (iii) a tailored data augmentation strategy that improves robustness to sensor occlusion.

In this paper, we propose ILA-agent, a general ILA framework that equips LLMs with a set of behavioral primitives. By modeling essential human-like behaviors as a suite of tools, ILA-agent enables LLMs to incrementally explore, apply, and verify language knowledge through structured interactions with the official documentation and execution environment. To provide a rigorous evaluation in a low-resource setting, we construct Cangjie-bench, a multi-task benchmark based on the novel statically-typed language Cangjie. We instantiate ILA-agent for Cangjie and evaluate its performance across code generation, translation, and program repair tasks.

This dependency puts them at risk of fraud and exploitation. To address these challenges, we first build a new Bangladeshi banknote dataset that includes both controlled and real-world scenarios, ensuring a more comprehensive and diverse representation. Next, to enhance the dataset's robustness, we incorporate four additional datasets, including public benchmarks, to cover various complexities and improve the model's generalization. To overcome the limitations of current recognition models, we propose a novel hybrid CNN architecture that combines MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNetB0 for efficient feature extraction. This is followed by an effective multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier to improve performance while keeping computational costs low, making the system suitable for resource-constrained devices. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves 97.95% accuracy on controlled datasets, 92.84% on complex backgrounds, and 94.98% accuracy when combining all datasets. The model's performance is thoroughly evaluated using five-fold cross-validation and seven metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen's Kappa, MCC, and AUC.

While other survey papers focus on the healthcare supply chain, operations, and medical emergency response aspects, this paper provides a comprehensive review of medical drones from the perspectives of flight dynamics and guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) systems. We first discuss the medical aerial delivery mission requirements and suitable uncrewed aerial system (UAS) configurations. We then address payload container design and optimization, and its effect on supplies and overall flight dynamics. We also explore the fundamental principles of GNC in the context of medical drone operations, highlighting key challenges arising from vibration, air temperature, pressure, and humidity, which affect the quality of medical supplies. The paper examines various GNC algorithms that can mitigate these challenges, as well as the algorithms' limitations. With these considerations, this survey aims to provide insights into optimizing GNC frameworks for medical drones, emphasizing research gaps and directions to improve real-world healthcare applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u533b\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u98de\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u5236\u5bfc\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff08GNC\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u673a\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\u3001\u8f7d\u8377\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u7269\u8d44\u548c\u98de\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86GNC\u539f\u7406\u53ca\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7efc\u8ff0\u5173\u6ce8\u533b\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ece\u98de\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u53caGNC\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u5bf9\u533b\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8be5\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u533b\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u539f\u7406\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u8c03\u7814\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u533b\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9002\u914d\u3001\u8f7d\u8377\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u98de\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u533b\u7597\u7269\u8d44\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5256\u6790\u4e86\u5236\u5bfc\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u539f\u7406\u3001\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u96be\u9898\u53ca\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4f18\u52a3\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u632f\u52a8\u3001\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u538b\u529b\u548c\u6e7f\u5ea6\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u533b\u7597\u7269\u8d44\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\uff0cGNC\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7f13\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709GNC\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u7814\u7a76\u5b58\u5728\u82e5\u5e72\u5f85\u586b\u8865\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u533b\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684GNC\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672a\u6765\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u7269\u8d44\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7b49\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u533b\u7597\u8fd0\u8f93\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

When the underlying sources are sensitive or copyright-protected, such reproduction raises issues of consent and compensation for creators and compliance risks for developers. We propose Anchored Decoding, a plug-and-play inference-time method for suppressing verbatim copying: it enables decoding from any risky LM trained on mixed-license data by keeping generation in bounded proximity to a permissively trained safe LM. Anchored Decoding adaptively allocates a user-chosen information budget over the generation trajectory and enforces per-step constraints that yield a sequence-level guarantee, enabling a tunable risk-utility trade-off. To make Anchored Decoding practically useful, we introduce a new permissively trained safe model (TinyComma 1.8B), as well as Anchored$_{\\mathrm{Byte}}$ Decoding, a byte-level variant of our method that enables cross-vocabulary fusion via the ByteSampler framework (Hayase et al., 2025). We evaluate our methods across six model pairs on long-form evaluations of copyright risk and utility. Anchored and Anchored$_{\\mathrm{Byte}}$ Decoding define a new Pareto frontier, preserving near-original fluency and factuality while eliminating up to 75% of the measurable copying gap (averaged over six copying metrics) between the risky baseline and a safe reference, at a modest inference overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAnchored Decoding\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6291\u5236\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9010\u5b57\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u7248\u6743\u6216\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u5e38\u4f1a\u9010\u5b57\u590d\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u6709\u7248\u6743\u6216\u654f\u611f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u5408\u89c4\u548c\u6743\u76ca\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u4fe1\u606f\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u590d\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6743\u8861\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAnchored Decoding\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u5f85\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u523b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u6298\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7Anchored$_{\\mathrm{Byte}}$ Decoding\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u8bcd\u8868\u5185\u5bb9\u878d\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578bTinyComma 1.8B\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8457\u4f5c\u6743\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6548\u7528\u7684\u957f\u6587\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cAnchored Decoding\u53ca\u5176\u5b57\u8282\u7ea7\u53d8\u4f53\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6d41\u7545\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u9ad8\u8fbe75%\u7684\u590d\u5236\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u516d\u9879\u590d\u5236\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Anchored Decoding\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u5b57\u590d\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7248\u6743\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present three progressively refined pipelines, culminating in a LeJEPA-inspired approach that enforces isotropic Gaussian constraints on learned image embeddings. Rather than introducing new theoretical guarantees, our work empirically evaluates how these constraints influence clustering consistency and pose estimation robustness in practice. Experimental results on IMC2025 demonstrate that Gaussian-constrained embeddings can improve scene separation and pose plausibility compared to heuristic-driven baselines, particularly in visually ambiguous settings. These findings suggest that theoretically motivated representation constraints offer a promising direction for bridging self-supervised learning principles and practical structure-from-motion pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u65e0\u76d1\u77633D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u573a\u666f\u3001\u5305\u542b\u6df7\u6742\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u56fe\u7247\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728IMC2025\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u5f80\u5f80\u6765\u6e90\u590d\u6742\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u5305\u542b\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bf9\u65e0\u76d1\u77633D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6781\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728IMC2025\u8fd9\u6837\u9700\u8981\u72ec\u7acb\u573a\u666f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u89c6\u89c9\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u573a\u666f\u533a\u5206\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u53d7LeJEPA\u67b6\u6784\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u9010\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u56fe\u7247\u5d4c\u5165\u65bd\u52a0\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ba1\u7ebf\u65e0\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9\u805a\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728IMC2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u5d4c\u5165\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u573a\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u5408\u7406\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6b67\u4e49\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u66f4\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7ed3\u6784\u5149\u6d41\uff08SfM\uff09\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u539f\u5219\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u8bc1\u636e\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In the field of robotics, a similar trend of rising complexity has emerged, driven in large part by the adoption of deep learning. While this shift has enabled the development of highly performant robot policies, their implementation as deep neural networks has posed challenges to traditional formal analysis, leading to models that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to interpret. In response, the robotics community has introduced new formal and semi-formal methods to support the precise specification of complex objectives, guide the learning process to achieve them, and enable the verification of learned policies against them. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of how formal methods have been used in recent robot learning research. We organize our discussion around two pillars: policy learning and policy verification. For both, we highlight representative techniques, compare their scalability and expressiveness, and summarize how they contribute to meaningfully improving realistic robot safety and correctness. We conclude with a discussion of remaining obstacles for achieving that goal and promising directions for advancing formal methods in robot learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u653f\u7b56\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u603b\u7ed3\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u53d1\u5c55\u540e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u65b0\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7684\u89c4\u683c\u5316\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u91c7\u7528\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e0e\u534a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5404\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5178\u578b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u8bc4\u8ff0\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u65f6\u4f9d\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aXAI-CLIP\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e34\u5e8a\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u4e14\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0d\u5f3a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86XAI-CLIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff08ROI\uff09\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u533a\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6d41\u7a0b\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u6781\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728FLARE22\u548cCHAOS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cXAI-CLIP\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e60%\u3001Dice\u5f97\u5206\u63d0\u534744.6%\u3001IoU\u63d0\u534796.7%\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u6270\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u4e14\u66f4\u5feb\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u56fe\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\uff0c\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f2a\u5f71\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\u5f15\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u578bXAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u7684\u900f\u660e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In unseen, unmapped, or GPS-denied settings, traditional metric map-based methods fall short, prompting a shift toward learning-based approaches with minimal exploration. In this work, we develop a hierarchical framework that decomposes the navigation decision-making process into multiple levels. Our method learns to select subgoals through a simple, transferable waypoint selection network. A key component of the approach is a latent-space memory module organized solely by visual similarity, as a proxy for distance. This alternative to graph-based topological representations proves sufficient for navigation tasks, providing a compact, light-weight, simple-to-train navigator that can find its way to the goal in novel locations. We show competitive results with a suite of SOTA methods in Habitat AI environments without using any odometry in training or inference. An additional contribution leverages the interpretablility of the framework for interactive navigation.

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a similar flexibility in adopting different personas and behaviors. Existing approaches, however, typically adapt such behavior through external knowledge such as prompting, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), or fine-tuning. We ask: do LLMs really need external context or parameters to adapt to different behaviors, or do they already have such knowledge embedded in their parameters? In this work, we show that LLMs already contain persona-specialized subnetworks in their parameter space. Using small calibration datasets, we identify distinct activation signatures associated with different personas. Guided by these statistics, we develop a masking strategy that isolates lightweight persona subnetworks. Building on the findings, we further discuss: how can we discover opposing subnetwork from the model that lead to binary-opposing personas, such as introvert-extrovert? To further enhance separation in binary opposition scenarios, we introduce a contrastive pruning strategy that identifies parameters responsible for the statistical divergence between opposing personas. Our method is entirely training-free and relies solely on the language model's existing parameter space. Across diverse evaluation settings, the resulting subnetworks exhibit significantly stronger persona alignment than baselines that require external knowledge while being more efficient.

Existing bird strike prevention strategies primarily rely on avian radar systems that detect and track birds in real time. A major limitation of these systems is their inability to identify bird species, an essential factor, as different species exhibit distinct flight behaviors, and altitudinal preference. To address this challenge, we propose an image-based bird classification framework using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), designed to work with camera systems for autonomous visual detection. The CNN is designed to identify bird species and provide critical input to species-specific predictive models for accurate flight path prediction. In addition to species identification, we implemented dedicated CNN classifiers to estimate flock formation type and flock size. These characteristics provide valuable supplementary information for aviation safety. Specifically, flock type and size offer insights into collective flight behavior, and trajectory dispersion . Flock size directly relates to the potential impact severity, as the overall damage risk increases with the combined kinetic energy of multiple birds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9e1f\u7c7b\u79cd\u7c7b\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u573a\u9e1f\u51fb\u9884\u9632\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u673a\u573a\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9e1f\u7c7b\u96f7\u8fbe\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u9e1f\u51fb\u9884\u9632\uff0c\u4f46\u96f7\u8fbe\u65e0\u6cd5\u5206\u8fa8\u9e1f\u7684\u79cd\u7c7b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7684\u98de\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1CNN\u7f51\u7edc\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u9e1f\u7c7b\u79cd\u522b\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u89c4\u6a21\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9e1f\u7c7b\u79cd\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7269\u79cd\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7269\u79cd\uff0c\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u9e1f\u7fa4\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u3002\u76f8\u5173\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u79cd\u7fa4\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u529b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6491\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u96f7\u8fbe\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u9e1f\u7c7b\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u573a\u9e1f\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u5224\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u52a9\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u822a\u7a7a\u5b89\u5168\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Sliding Mode Control (SMC) has emerged as a robust approach for managing uncertainties and disturbances in manipulator dynamics, providing superior control performance compared to traditional methods. This study implements a model-based SMC (MBSMC) utilizing a hyperbolic tangent function to regulate the motion of a manipulator mounted on a mobile platform operating inside a self-driving chemical laboratory. Given the manipulator's role in transporting fragile glass vessels filled with hazardous chemicals, the controller is specifically designed to minimize abrupt transitions and achieve gentle, accurate trajectory tracking. The proposed controller is benchmarked against a non-model-based SMC (NMBSMC) and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller using a comprehensive set of joint and Cartesian metrics. Compared to PID and NMBSMC, MBSMC achieved significantly smoother motion and up to 90% lower control effort, validating its robustness and precision for autonomous laboratory operations. Experimental trials confirmed successful execution of tasks such as vessel grasping and window operation, which failed under PID control due to its limited ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances, resulting in substantial trajectory tracking errors. The results validate the controller's effectiveness in achieving smooth, precise, and safe manipulator motions, supporting the advancement of intelligent mobile manipulators in autonomous laboratory environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff08MBSMC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u64cd\u63a7\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5e73\u7a33\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u642c\u8fd0\u6613\u788e\u5371\u9669\u6750\u6599\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u9700\u5b89\u5168\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u642c\u8fd0\u8106\u5f31\u548c\u5371\u9669\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u54c1\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982PID\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u80fd\u5e73\u6ed1\u63a7\u5236\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff08MBSMC\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5207\u6fc0\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u975e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\uff08NMBSMC\uff09\u548cPID\u63a7\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4NMBSMC\u548cPID\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0cMBSMC\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u987a\u5229\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u7cbe\u5bc6\u6293\u53d6\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5f00/\u5173\u7a97\u3001\u642c\u8fd0\u74f6\u4f53\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ed1\u6a21\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5316\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8ePID\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper presents Open TutorAI, an open-source educational platform based on LLMs and generative technologies that provides dynamic, personalized tutoring. The system integrates natural language processing with customizable 3D avatars to enable multimodal learner interaction. Through a structured onboarding process, it captures each learner's goals and preferences in order to configure a learner-specific AI assistant. This assistant is accessible via both text-based and avatar-driven interfaces. The platform includes tools for organizing content, providing embedded feedback, and offering dedicated interfaces for learners, educators, and parents. This work focuses on learner-facing components, delivering a tool for adaptive support that responds to individual learner profiles without requiring technical expertise. Its assistant-generation pipeline and avatar integration enhance engagement and emotional presence, creating a more humanized, immersive learning environment. Embedded learning analytics support self-regulated learning by tracking engagement patterns and generating actionable feedback. The result is Open TutorAI, which unites modular architecture, generative AI, and learner analytics within an open-source framework.

Here, we propose a mechanistic insight by analyzing the representational geometry of open-weight VLMs (Qwen, InternVL, Gemma), comparing methodologies to distill \"concept vectors\" - latent directions encoding visual concepts. We validate our concept vectors via steering interventions that reliably manipulate model behavior in both simplified and naturalistic vision tasks (e.g., forcing the model to perceive a red flower as blue). We observe that the geometric overlap between these vectors strongly correlates with specific error patterns, offering a grounded quantitative framework to understand how internal representations shape model behavior and drive visual failures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u201d\u64cd\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5411\u91cf\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5408\u5ea6\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1VLMs\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5c40\u9650\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5982\u7ed1\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u7406\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u6e90VLM\uff08\u5982Qwen\u3001InternVL\u3001Gemma\uff09\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u201c\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u201d\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5982\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u7ea2\u82b1\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u84dd\u82b1\uff09\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u64cd\u63a7\uff0c\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u64cd\u7eb5VLM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdbVLM\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In practice, preferences can be noisy, incomplete, or even misleading, which can degrade answer quality when applied naively. Motivated by the observation that stable personality traits shape everyday preferences, we study personality as a principled ''latent'' signal behind preference statements. Through extensive experiments, we find that conditioning on personality-aligned preferences substantially improves personalized question answering: selecting preferences consistent with a user's inferred personality increases answer-choice accuracy from 29.25% to 76%, compared to using randomly selected preferences. Based on these findings, we introduce PACIFIC (Preference Alignment Choices Inference for Five-factor Identity Characterization), a personality-labeled preference dataset containing 1200 preference statements spanning diverse domains (e.g., travel, movies, education), annotated with Big-Five (OCEAN) trait directions.

Prior approaches to bridge this gap are largely limited by oversimplified isotropic assumptions, hindering their application in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we address these limitations by precisely characterizing the geometric shape of the modality gap and leveraging it for efficient model scaling. First, we propose the Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory, which decomposes the modality gap within a frozen reference frame into stable biases and anisotropic residuals. Guided by this precise modeling, we introduce ReAlign, a training-free modality alignment strategy. Utilizing statistics from massive unpaired data, ReAlign aligns text representation into the image representation distribution via a three-step process comprising Anchor, Trace, and Centroid Alignment, thereby explicitly rectifying geometric misalignment. Building on ReAlign, we propose ReVision, a scalable training paradigm for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). ReVision integrates ReAlign into the pretraining stage, enabling the model to learn the distribution of visual representations from unpaired text before visual instruction tuning, without the need for large-scale, high-quality image-text pairs. Our framework demonstrates that statistically aligned unpaired data can effectively substitute for expensive image-text pairs, offering a robust path for the efficient scaling of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u7cbe\u786e\u6d88\u9664\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u8868\u5f81\u95f4\u7684Modality Gap\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34 Modality Gap \u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5373\u4fbf\u8868\u8fbe\u76f8\u540c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5176\u5d4c\u5165\u4ecd\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u79fb\u3002\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u5f25\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa Fixed-frame Modality Gap Theory\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u504f\u7f6e\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6b8b\u5dee\u3002\u968f\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565 ReAlign\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u6b65\uff08\u951a\u5b9a\u3001\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8d28\u5fc3\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e ReAlign \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f ReVision\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u987b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u65f6\u5373\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u9760\u7edf\u8ba1\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u751a\u81f3\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11 Modality Gap\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This paper surveys the state-of-the-art in the nexus of SLAM and Wireless Communications, attributing the bidirectional impact of each with a focus on visual SLAM (V-SLAM) integration. We provide an overview of key concepts related to wireless signal propagation, geometric channel modeling, and radio frequency (RF)-based localization and sensing. In addition to this, we show image processing techniques that can detect landmarks, proactively predicting optimal paths for wireless channels. Several dimensions are considered, including the prerequisites, techniques, background, and future directions and challenges of the intersection between SLAM and wireless communications. We analyze mathematical approaches such as probabilistic models, and spatial methods for signal processing, as well as key technological aspects. We expose techniques and items towards enabling a highly effective retrieval of the autonomous robot state. Among other interesting findings, we observe that monocular V-SLAM would benefit from RF relevant information, as the latter can serve as a proxy for the scale ambiguity resolution. Conversely, we find that wireless communications in the context of 5G and beyond can potentially benefit from visual odometry that is central in SLAM. Moreover, we examine other sources besides the camera for SLAM and describe the twofold relation with wireless communications. Finally, integrated solutions performing joint communications and SLAM are still in their infancy: theoretical and practical advancements are required to add higher-level localization and semantic perception capabilities to RF and multi-antenna technologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u540c\u6b65\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5730\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\uff08SLAM\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\uff08V-SLAM\uff09\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u6280\u672f\u73b0\u72b6\u3001\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5546\u7528\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u4f20\u611f\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5065\u58ee\u7684\u8054\u5408\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0eSLAM\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u667a\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8c03\u67e5\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u5c04\u9891\uff08RF\uff09\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5355\u76eeV-SLAM\u4e2d\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0cSLAM\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\u53ef\u8f85\u52a95G\u7b49\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u8fd8\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u6e90\u4e0e\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0eSLAM\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0eSLAM\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u521d\u7ea7\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7a81\u7834\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u63d0\u5347RF\u53ca\u5929\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\u5728\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this paper, we address the challenges of long-context question answering in context of long-form answers given the idiosyncrasies of legal documents. We propose a question answering system that can (a) deconstruct domain-specific vocabulary for better retrieval from source documents, (b) parse complex document layouts while isolating sections and footnotes and linking them appropriately, (c) generate comprehensive answers using precise domain-specific vocabulary. We also introduce a coverage metric that classifies the performance into recall-based coverage categories allowing human users to evaluate the recall with ease.

We propose Fair Context Learning (FCL), an episodic TTA framework that avoids entropy minimization by explicitly addressing shared-evidence bias. Motivated by our additive evidence decomposition assumption, FCL decouples adaptation into (i) augmentation-based exploration to identify plausible class candidates, and (ii) fairness-driven calibration that adapts text contexts to equalize sensitivity to common visual evidence. This fairness constraint mitigates partial feature obsession and enables effective calibration of text embeddings without relying on entropy reduction. Through extensive evaluation, we empirically validate our theoretical motivation and show that FCL achieves competitive adaptation performance relative to state-of-the-art TTA methods across diverse domain-shift and fine-grained benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08TTA\uff09\u6846\u67b6Fair Context Learning\uff08FCL\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347VLM\u6a21\u578b\u5982CLIP\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u907f\u514d\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff08spurious correlation\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5f3a\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0bVLM\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CLIP\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e0a\u8ff0\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516c\u5e73\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FCL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u52a0\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5c06TTA\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5229\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u5019\u9009\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u6574\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4f7f\u9488\u5bf9\u5171\u4eab\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u66f4\u52a0\u5747\u8861\u3002\u8be5\u516c\u5e73\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u65b0\u7684TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u8868\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "conclusion": "FCL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316TTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u662fTTA\u9886\u57df\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

These environments often involve delicate laboratory equipment, unpredictable environmental interactions, and occasional human intervention, making compliant and force aware control essential for ensuring safety, adaptability, and reliability. This paper introduces a motion-planning framework centered on admittance control to enable adaptive and compliant robotic manipulation. Unlike conventional schemes, the proposed approach integrates an admittance controller directly into trajectory execution, allowing the manipulator to dynamically respond to external forces during interaction. This capability enables human operators to override or redirect the robot's motion in real time. A vision algorithm based on structured planar pose estimation is employed to detect and localize textured planar objects through feature extraction, homography estimation, and depth fusion, thereby providing an initial target configuration for motion planning. The vision based initialization establishes the reference trajectory, while the embedded admittance controller ensures that trajectory execution remains safe, adaptive, and responsive to external forces or human intervention. The proposed strategy is validated using textured image detection as a proof of concept. Future work will extend the framework to SDL environments involving transparent laboratory objects where compliant motion planning can further enhance autonomy, safety, and human-robot collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\uff08SDLs\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u7cbe\u5bc6\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u5076\u53d1\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u96c6\u6210\u987a\u5e94\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u81c2\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u529b\u5373\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e73\u9762\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u59ff\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb9\u7406\u5316\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u53d7\u529b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5904\u7406\u900f\u660e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7269\u4f53\u7b49\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u52a0\u5f3a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation on how to enable directional multi-talker speech understanding capabilities for LLMs, specifically in smart glasses usecase. We propose two novel approaches to integrate directivity into LLMs: (1) a cascaded system that leverages a source separation front-end module, and (2) an end-to-end system that utilizes serialized output training. All of the approaches utilize a multi-microphone array embedded in smart glasses to optimize directivity interpretation and processing in a streaming manner.

Neuro-fuzzy hybrids such as DCNFIS replace fully connected CNN classifiers with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) to improve interpretability, yet their robustness remains underexplored. This work compares standard CNNs (ConvNet, VGG, ResNet18) with their ANFIS-augmented counterparts on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under gradient-based (PGD) and gradient-free (Square) attacks. Results show that ANFIS integration does not consistently improve clean accuracy and has architecture-dependent effects on robustness: ResNet18-ANFIS exhibits improved adversarial robustness, while VGG-ANFIS often underperforms its baseline. These findings suggest that neuro-fuzzy augmentation can enhance robustness in specific architectures but is not universally beneficial.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6807\u51c6CNN\u4e0e\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u7cca\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08ANFIS\uff09\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ANFIS\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u975e\u4e00\u5f8b\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "CNN\u867d\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u4e14\u6613\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u7cca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982ANFIS\uff09\u589e\u5f3aCNN\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd8\u6ca1\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7528\u6807\u51c6CNN\uff08ConvNet\u3001VGG\u3001ResNet18\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u878d\u5408ANFIS\u540e\u7684\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08MNIST\u3001Fashion-MNIST\u3001CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5728PGD\uff08\u68af\u5ea6\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u4e0eSquare\uff08\u975e\u68af\u5ea6\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u878d\u5408ANFIS\u540e\uff0c\u5e76\u672a\u666e\u904d\u63d0\u5347\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u5173\uff1aResNet18-ANFIS\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\uff0cVGG-ANFIS\u8868\u73b0\u5219\u4e0d\u5982\u539fVGG\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u6a21\u7cca\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u90e8\u5206CNN\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5176\u589e\u76ca\u5177\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3002"}}

However, traditional Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) methods struggle to scale in this domain. While HARA relies on enumerating risks for finite and pre-defined function lists, Embodied AI operates on open-ended natural language instructions, creating a challenge of combinatorial interaction risks. Whereas Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this scalability challenge, they often lack physical grounding, yielding semantically superficial and incoherent hazard descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework ARGOS (AttRibute-Guided cOmbinatorial reaSoning), which bridges the gap between open-ended user instructions and concrete physical attributes. By dynamically decomposing entities from instructions into these fine-grained properties, ARGOS grounds LLM reasoning in causal risk factors to generate physically plausible hazard scenarios. It then instantiates abstract safety standards, such as ISO 13482, into context-specific Functional Safety Requirements (FSRs) by integrating these scenarios with robot capabilities. Extensive experiments validate that ARGOS produces high-quality FSRs and outperforms baselines in identifying long-tail risks. Overall, this work paves the way for systematic and grounded functional safety requirement generation, a critical step toward the safe industrial deployment of Embodied AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ARGOS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u5730\u5206\u6790\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08HARA\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5177\u8eabAI\u9762\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ec4\u5408\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u9669\u63cf\u8ff0\u8868\u6d45\u6216\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ARGOS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u3002\u7136\u540eARGOS\u5c06\u56fd\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u5982ISO 13482\uff09\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\uff08FSRs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aARGOS\u5728\u751f\u6210FSRs\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u201c\u957f\u5c3e\u201d\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u76ee\u524d\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ARGOS\u4e3a\u5177\u8eabAI\u529f\u80fd\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u5316\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, existing hallucination standards and evaluation metrics focus primarily on factual correctness, treating all errors as equally severe. This obscures clinically relevant failure modes, particularly when models generate unsupported but actionable medical language. We propose a risk-sensitive evaluation framework that quantifies hallucinations through the presence of risk-bearing language, including treatment directives, contraindications, urgency cues, and mentions of high-risk medications. Rather than assessing clinical correctness, our approach evaluates the potential impact of hallucinated content if acted upon. We further combine risk scoring with a relevance measure to identify high-risk, low-grounding failures. We apply this framework to three instruction-tuned language models using controlled patient-facing prompts designed as safety stress tests. Our results show that models with similar surface-level behavior exhibit substantially different risk profiles and that standard evaluation metrics fail to capture these distinctions. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating risk sensitivity into hallucination evaluation and suggest that evaluation validity is critically dependent on task and prompt design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4ee5\u98ce\u9669\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u9519\u8bef\u89c6\u4e3a\u540c\u7b49\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u6d89\u53ca\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u533b\u7597\u6307\u4ee4\u7b49\u66f4\u5177\u5371\u5bb3\u6027\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9274\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u95ee\u7b54\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u5b9e\u9645\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u52a0\u6ce8\u91cd\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u6709\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u4ee4\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982\u6cbb\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\u3001\u7981\u5fcc\u3001\u7d27\u6025\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u836f\u7269\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ee5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u95ee\u9898\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u98ce\u9669\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u8fa8\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u5c06\u98ce\u9669\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u533b\u7597\u5e94\u7528\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Recent Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promising potential for performing end-to-end KIE directly from document images. To enable a comprehensive and systematic evaluation across realistic and diverse application scenarios, we introduce UNIKIE-BENCH, a unified benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the KIE capabilities of LMMs. UNIKIE-BENCH consists of two complementary tracks: a constrained-category KIE track with scenario-predefined schemas that reflect practical application needs, and an open-category KIE track that extracts any key information that is explicitly present in the document. Experiments on 15 state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial performance degradation under diverse schema definitions, long-tail key fields, and complex layouts, along with pronounced performance disparities across different document types and scenarios. These findings underscore persistent challenges in grounding accuracy and layout-aware reasoning for LMM-based KIE.

Users often employ follow-up questions to refine their intent, expecting LLMs to adapt dynamically. However, recent research reveals that LLMs suffer a substantial performance drop in multi-turn settings compared to single-turn interactions with fully specified instructions, a phenomenon termed ``Lost in Conversation'' (LiC). While this prior work attributes LiC to model unreliability, we argue that the root cause lies in an intent alignment gap rather than intrinsic capability deficits. In this paper, we first demonstrate that LiC is not a failure of model capability but rather a breakdown in interaction between users and LLMs. We theoretically show that scaling model size or improving training alone cannot resolve this gap, as it arises from structural ambiguity in conversational context rather than representational limitations. To address this, we propose to decouple intent understanding from task execution through a Mediator-Assistant architecture. By utilizing an experience-driven Mediator to explicate user inputs into explicit, well-structured instructions based on historical interaction patterns, our approach effectively bridges the gap between vague user intent and model interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that this method significantly mitigates performance degradation in multi-turn conversations across diverse LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5355\u8f6e\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u201c\u8ff7\u5931\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u201d(LiC)\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528Mediator-Assistant\u67b6\u6784\u6865\u63a5\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bfc\u81f4\u3002\u7136\u800c\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMediator-Assistant\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u505a\u6cd5\u662f\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Mediator\u6839\u636e\u4f1a\u8bdd\u5386\u53f2\u628a\u7528\u6237\u542b\u7cca\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u4e3a\u660e\u786e\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u518d\u4ea4\u7531\u52a9\u624b\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5404\u7c7b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u9000\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u3002\u53ea\u9760\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u9700\u7528\u65b0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u663e\u5f0f\u7406\u6e05\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Existing AI-based methods primarily treat diagnosis as a visual pattern recognition task and do not reflect the structured clinical reasoning used by dental professionals. These approaches also require large amounts of expert-annotated data and often struggle to generalize across diverse real-world imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we present OMNI-Dent, a data-efficient and explainable diagnostic framework that incorporates clinical reasoning principles into a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based pipeline. The framework operates on multi-view smartphone photographs,embeds diagnostic heuristics from dental experts, and guides a general-purpose VLM to perform tooth-level evaluation without dental-specific fine-tuning of the VLM. By utilizing the VLM's existing visual-linguistic capabilities, OMNI-Dent aims to support diagnostic assessment in settings where curated clinical imaging is unavailable.

The airspace model captures dense air traffic departure and arrival flows, helicopter corridors, and prohibited zones and is demonstrated with a Washington, D.C., area case study. Historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data are processed to estimate air traffic density. A low-latency computational geometry algorithm generates proximity-based heatmaps around high-risk corridors and restricted regions. Airspace risk is quantified as the cumulative exposure time of a landing trajectory within congested regions, while ground risk is assessed from overflown population density to jointly guide trajectory selection. A landing site selection module further mitigates disruption to nominal air traffic operations. Benchmarking against minimum-risk Dubins solutions demonstrates that the proposed planner achieves lower joint risk and reduced airspace disruption while maintaining real-time performance. Under airspace-risk-only conditions, the planner generates trajectories within an average of 2.9 seconds on a laptop computer. Future work will incorporate dynamic air traffic updates to enable spatiotemporal contingency landing planning that minimizes the need for real-time traffic rerouting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u98de\u673a\u7d27\u6025\u964d\u843d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u641c\u7d22\u578b\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u822a\u73ed\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5730\u9762\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5229\u7528ADS-B\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u534e\u76db\u987f\u7279\u533a\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u57df\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8054\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bc6\u96c6\u7a7a\u57df\u4e0b\u98de\u673a\u53d1\u751f\u7d27\u6025\u60c5\u51b5\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u5b89\u5168\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u822a\u73ed\u548c\u5730\u9762\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u7d27\u8feb\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2ADS-B\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u57df\u822a\u73ed\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba1\u7b97\u51e0\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u533a\u57df\u7684\u70ed\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u5c06\u7a7a\u57df\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5730\u9762\u4eba\u53e3\u5bc6\u5ea6\u98ce\u9669\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u8f68\u8ff9\u9009\u62e9\u7efc\u5408\u8003\u91cf\u7a7a\u57df\u4e2d\u5176\u5b83\u98de\u673a\u5e72\u6270\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u66b4\u9732\u5ea6\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u7740\u9646\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u5757\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u822a\u73ed\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6700\u5c0f\u98ce\u9669Dubins\u8def\u5f84\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u53ef\u5728\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u8054\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u5bf9\u7a7a\u57df\u8fd0\u884c\u5e72\u6270\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7d27\u6025\u964d\u843d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4e14\u5e73\u5747\u4ec5\u97002.9\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7d27\u6025\u7740\u9646\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u7a7a\u57df\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u53cb\u597d\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u7a7a\u57df\u98de\u673a\u7d27\u6025\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u7a7a\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Despite recent progress in retrieval-augmented and graph-based QA methods, systematic evaluation in this setting remains limited, especially for low-resource languages such as Vietnamese, due to the lack of benchmark datasets that explicitly support multihop reasoning over healthcare regulations. In this work, we introduce the Vietnamese Healthcare Regulations-Multihop Reasoning Dataset (ViHERMES), a benchmark designed for multihop QA over Vietnamese healthcare regulatory documents. ViHERMES consists of high-quality question-answer pairs that require reasoning across multiple regulations and capture diverse dependency patterns, including amendment tracing, cross-document comparison, and procedural synthesis. To construct the dataset, we propose a controlled multihop QA generation pipeline based on semantic clustering and graph-inspired data mining, followed by large language model-based generation with structured evidence and reasoning annotations. We further present a graph-aware retrieval framework that models formal legal relations at the level of legal units and supports principled context expansion for legally valid and coherent answers. Experimental results demonstrate that ViHERMES provides a challenging benchmark for evaluating multihop regulatory QA systems and that the proposed graph-aware approach consistently outperforms strong retrieval-based baselines.

We present a novel unsupervised semi-parametric framework COMBOOD for OOD detection with respect to image recognition. Our framework combines signals from two distance metrics, nearest-neighbor and Mahalanobis, to derive a confidence score for an inference point to be out-of-distribution. The former provides a non-parametric approach to OOD detection. The latter provides a parametric, simple, yet effective method for detecting OOD data points, especially, in the far OOD scenario, where the inference point is far apart from the training data set in the embedding space. However, its performance is not satisfactory in the near OOD scenarios that arise in practical situations. Our COMBOOD framework combines the two signals in a semi-parametric setting to provide a confidence score that is accurate both for the near-OOD and far-OOD scenarios. We show experimental results with the COMBOOD framework for different types of feature extraction strategies. We demonstrate experimentally that COMBOOD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods on the OpenOOD (both version 1 and most recent version 1.5) benchmark datasets (for both far-OOD and near-OOD) as well as on the documents dataset in terms of accuracy. On a majority of the benchmark datasets, the improvements in accuracy resulting from the COMBOOD framework are statistically significant.

The stable locomotion of these models is limited to tilted surfaces, requiring gravitational energy. Various techniques, such as actuation through the ankle and hip joints, have been proposed to extend the applicability of these models to level ground and rough terrain with improved locomotion efficiency. However, most of these techniques rely on impulsive energy injection schemes and torsional springs, which are quite challenging to implement in a physical platform. Here, a new model is proposed, named triggering controlled ankle actuated compass gait (TC-AACG), which allows non-instantaneous compliant ankle pushoff. The proposed technique can be implemented in physical platforms via series elastic actuators (SEAs). Our systematic examination shows that the proposed approach extends the locomotion capabilities of a biped model compared to impulsive ankle pushoff approach.

We present TernaryLM, a 132M parameter transformer architecture that employs native 1-bit ternary quantization {-1, 0, +1} during training, achieving significant memory reduction without sacrificing language modeling capability. Unlike post-training quantization approaches that quantize pre-trained full-precision models, TernaryLM learns quantization-aware representations from scratch using straight-through estimators and adaptive per-layer scaling factors. Our experiments demonstrate: (1) validation perplexity of 58.42 on TinyStories; (2) downstream transfer with 82.47 percent F1 on MRPC paraphrase detection; (3) 2.4x memory reduction (498MB vs 1197MB) with comparable inference latency; and (4) stable training dynamics across diverse corpora. We provide layer-wise quantization analysis showing that middle transformer layers exhibit highest compatibility with extreme quantization, informing future non-uniform precision strategies.

Despite the promise of deep learning for automating MFL interpretation, progress toward reliable models has been constrained by the absence of a large-scale public dataset and benchmark, making fair comparison and reproducible evaluation difficult. We introduce \\textbf{PipeMFL-240K}, a large-scale, meticulously annotated dataset and benchmark for complex object detection in pipeline MFL pseudo-color images. PipeMFL-240K reflects real-world inspection complexity and poses several unique challenges: (i) an extremely long-tailed distribution over \\textbf{12} categories, (ii) a high prevalence of tiny objects that often comprise only a handful of pixels, and (iii) substantial intra-class variability. The dataset contains \\textbf{240,320} images and \\textbf{191,530} high-quality bounding-box annotations, collected from 11 pipelines spanning approximately \\textbf{1,480} km. Extensive experiments are conducted with state-of-the-art object detectors to establish baselines. Results show that modern detectors still struggle with the intrinsic properties of MFL data, highlighting considerable headroom for improvement, while PipeMFL-240K provides a reliable and challenging testbed to drive future research. As the first public dataset and the first benchmark of this scale and scope for pipeline MFL inspection, it provides a critical foundation for efficient pipeline diagnostics as well as maintenance planning and is expected to accelerate algorithmic innovation and reproducible research in MFL-based pipeline integrity assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PipeMFL-240K\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u78c1\u901a\u6cc4\u6f0f\uff08MFL\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b240,320\u5e45\u56fe\u50cf\u548c191,530\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u652f\u6301MFL\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ba1\u9053\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5173\u4e4e\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u800cMFL\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u5173\u952e\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5316MFL\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53d7\u5230\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u516c\u6b63\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u590d\u73b0\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u4e9f\u9700\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63a8\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6807\u6ce8\u4e86\u6765\u81ea11\u6761\u603b\u957f\u7ea61,480\u516c\u91cc\u7ba1\u9053\u7684MFL\u4f2a\u5f69\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6db5\u76d612\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u603b\u8ba1240,320\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e191,530\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u8fb9\u6846\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u70b9\u5f3a\u8c03\u7c7b\u522b\u6781\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u3001\u5927\u91cf\u5fae\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u53ca\u660e\u663e\u7c7b\u5185\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e3b\u6d41\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9MFL\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5185\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002PipeMFL-240K\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PipeMFL-240K\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u3001\u9762\u5411MFL\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u7ba1\u9053\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u7ef4\u62a4\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c06\u52a0\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e3aMFL\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u8bfb\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors (e.g.,~lidar) have proven useful in mobile robotics, where high-resolution sensors can be used for simultaneous localization and mapping. In soft and continuum robotics, however, these high-resolution sensors are too large for practical use. This, combined with the deformable nature of such robots, has resulted in continuum robot (CR) localization and mapping in unstructured environments being a largely untouched area. In this work, we present a localization technique for CRs that relies on small, low-resolution ToF sensors distributed along the length of the robot. By fusing measurement information with a robot shape prior, we show that accurate localization is possible despite each sensor experiencing frequent degenerate scenarios. We achieve an average localization error of 2.5cm in position and 7.2\u00b0 in rotation across all experimental conditions with a 53cm long robot. We demonstrate that the results are repeated across multiple environments, in both simulation and real-world experiments, and study robustness in the estimation to deviations in the prior map.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4f53\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff08CR\uff09\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6cbf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u957f\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ToF\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u72b6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e14\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ToF\uff08\u5982\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4f53\u79ef\u8fc7\u5927\u548c\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002\u672c\u9886\u57dfCR\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5efa\u56fe\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5c0f\u578b\u3001\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684ToF\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6cbf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u672c\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5c06\u5404\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b64\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b8c\u6210\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4f30\u7b97\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u5355\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ecf\u5e38\u9047\u5230\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f53\u5398\u7c73\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e862.5\u5398\u7c73\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bef\u5dee\u548c7.2\u5ea6\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u91cd\u590d\u83b7\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u5730\u56fe\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Heuristic pruning methods are efficient but sensitive to activation outliers, while reconstruction-based approaches improve fidelity at the cost of heavy computation. In this work, we propose a lightweight post-training pruning framework based on first-order statistical properties of model weights and activations. During pruning, channel-wise statistics are used to calibrate magnitude-based importance scores, reducing bias from activation-dominated channels. After pruning, we apply an analytic energy compensation to correct distributional distortions caused by weight removal. Both steps operate without retraining, gradients, or second-order information. Experiments across multiple LLM families, sparsity patterns, and evaluation tasks show that the proposed approach improves pruning performance while maintaining computational cost comparable to heuristic methods.

However, existing remote sensing (RS) benchmarks remain heavily biased toward perception tasks, such as object recognition and scene classification. This limitation hinders the development of MLLMs for cognitively demanding RS applications. To address this, , we propose a Vision Language ReaSoning Benchmark (VLRS-Bench), which is the first benchmark exclusively dedicated to complex RS reasoning. Structured across the three core dimensions of Cognition, Decision, and Prediction, VLRS-Bench comprises 2,000 question-answer pairs with an average length of 71 words, spanning 14 tasks and up to eight temporal phases. VLRS-Bench is constructed via a specialized pipeline that integrates RS-specific priors and expert knowledge to ensure geospatial realism and reasoning complexity.

Developing such agents requires diverse, large-scale datasets. Prior frameworks generate synthetic data for long-term human-robot interactions but fail to model the bidirectional influence between human behavior and household environments. Our proposed generative framework creates household datasets at scale through loosely coupled generation of long-term human-robot interactions and environments. Human personas influence environment generation, while environment schematics and semantics shape human-robot interactions.\n  The generated 3D data includes rich static context such as object and environment semantics, and temporal context capturing human and agent behaviors over extended periods. Our flexible tool allows users to define dataset characteristics via natural language prompts, enabling configuration of environment and human activity data through natural language specifications. The tool creates variations of user-defined configurations, enabling scalable data generation.\n  We validate our framework through statistical evaluation using multi-modal embeddings and key metrics: cosine similarity, mutual information gain, intervention analysis, and iterative improvement validation. Statistical comparisons show good alignment with real-world datasets (HOMER) with cosine similarity (0.60), while synthetic datasets (Wang et al.) show moderate alignment (0.27). Intervention analysis across age, organization, and sleep pattern changes shows statistically significant effects (p < 0.001) with large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 0.51-1.12), confirming bidirectional coupling translates persona traits into measurable environmental and behavioral differences. These contributions enable development and testing of household smart devices at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u957f\u671f\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u52a8\u548c\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u73af\u5883\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u591a\u9879\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6491\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5ead\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u63d0\u4f9b\u5355\u5411\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u6d3b\u4e60\u60ef\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u6613\u4e8e\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u751f\u6210\u3001\u4e14\u53ef\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u677e\u8026\u5408\u8054\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3002\u4eba\u8bbe\u7279\u5f81\u5f71\u54cd\u73af\u5883\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u53cd\u8fc7\u6765\u53c8\u5851\u9020\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u5de5\u5177\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u73af\u5883\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6d3b\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3001\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u3001\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4ea7\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08HOMER\uff09\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e3a0.60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff080.27\uff09\u3002\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6574\u7406\u4e60\u60ef\u3001\u4f5c\u606f\u89c4\u5f8b\uff09\u5747\u4ea7\u751f\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\uff08p<0.001\uff09\u3001\u6548\u679c\u91cf\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4eba\u8bbe-\u73af\u5883\u53cc\u5411\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u4eba\u673a\u4e92\u52a8\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u6240\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bf9\u63a8\u52a8\u5bb6\u5ead\u667a\u80fd\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Yet, existing alignment datasets such as ANTHROPIC-HH and DICES rely on demographically narrow annotator pools, overlooking variation in safety perception across communities. Demo-SafetyBench addresses this gap by modeling demographic pluralism directly at the prompt level, decoupling value framing from responses. In Stage I, prompts from DICES are reclassified into 14 safety domains (adapted from BEAVERTAILS) using Mistral 7B-Instruct-v0.3, retaining demographic metadata and expanding low-resource domains via Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with SimHash-based deduplication, yielding 43,050 samples. In Stage II, pluralistic sensitivity is evaluated using LLMs-as-Raters-Gemma-7B, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-2-7B-under zero-shot inference.

The Owen formula for hierarchical Shapley values has been widely used to interpret machine learning (ML) models and their learned representations. However, existing hierarchical Shapley approaches do not exploit the multiscale structure of image data, leading to slow convergence and weak alignment with the actual morphological features. Moreover, no prior Shapley method has leveraged data-aware hierarchies for Computer Vision tasks, leaving a gap in model interpretability of structured visual data. To address this, this paper introduces ShapBPT, a novel data-aware XCV method based on the hierarchical Shapley formula. ShapBPT assigns Shapley coefficients to a multiscale hierarchical structure tailored for images, the Binary Partition Tree (BPT). By using this data-aware hierarchical partitioning, ShapBPT ensures that feature attributions align with intrinsic image morphology, effectively prioritizing relevant regions while reducing computational overhead. This advancement connects hierarchical Shapley methods with image data, providing a more efficient and semantically meaningful approach to visual interpretability. Experimental results confirm ShapBPT's effectiveness, demonstrating superior alignment with image structures and improved efficiency over existing XCV methods, and a 20-subject user study confirming that ShapBPT explanations are preferred by humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u578bXCV\u65b9\u6cd5ShapBPT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8c03\u67e5\u5747\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u6162\u4e14\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9762\u5411\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u611f\u77e5\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faShapBPT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06Shapley\u7cfb\u6570\u5206\u914d\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u5272\u6811\uff08Binary Partition Tree, BPT\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "ShapBPT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709XCV\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0cShapBPT\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u88ab\u4eba\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\u6240\u504f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "ShapBPT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5206\u5c42Shapley\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Introducing greater autonomy to these systems can simultaneously make them more effective as well as reliable. Thus, the ability to rapidly engineer and deploy autonomous aerial systems has become of strategic importance. In the 2010s, a combination of high-performance compute, data, and open-source software led to the current deep learning and AI boom, unlocking decades of prior theoretical work. Robotics is on the cusp of a similar transformation. However, physical AI faces unique hurdles, often combined under the umbrella term \"simulation-to-reality gap\". These span from modeling shortcomings to the complexity of vertically integrating the highly heterogeneous hardware and software systems typically found in field robots. To address the latter, we introduce aerial-autonomy-stack, an open-source, end-to-end framework designed to streamline the pipeline from (GPU-accelerated) perception to (flight controller-based) action. Our stack allows the development of aerial autonomy using ROS2 and provides a common interface for two of the most popular autopilots: PX4 and ArduPilot.

Existing works use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to align LLMs. However, these works face challenges in multi-objective settings, such as SFT leading to interference between conflicting objectives, while MoEs suffer from miscalibrated routing. We term this failure mode Axis Collapse, marked by (1) disjoint feature spaces causing catastrophic forgetting, and (2) unreliable inference from misrouted experts. To resolve this, we propose AlignX, a two-stage framework. Stage 1 uses prompt-injected fine-tuning to extract axis-specific task features, mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Stage 2 deploys a MoCaE module that calibrates expert routing using fractal and natural geometry, improving inference reliability.

Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split.

However, the standard practice of sampling from random Gaussian noise often requires multiple iterative steps to produce clean actions, leading to high inference latency that incurs a major bottleneck for real-time control. In this paper, we challenge the necessity of uninformed noise sampling and propose Action-to-Action flow matching (A2A), a novel policy paradigm that shifts from random sampling to initialization informed by the previous action. Unlike existing methods that treat proprioceptive action feedback as static conditions, A2A leverages historical proprioceptive sequences, embedding them into a high-dimensional latent space as the starting point for action generation. This design bypasses costly iterative denoising while effectively capturing the robot's physical dynamics and temporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that A2A exhibits high training efficiency, fast inference speed, and improved generalization. Notably, A2A enables high-quality action generation in as few as a single inference step (0.56 ms latency), and exhibits superior robustness to visual perturbations and enhanced generalization to unseen configurations. Lastly, we also extend A2A to video generation, demonstrating its broader versatility in temporal modeling.

In this study, we aim to improve the summarization of Indian legal text to generate summaries in both English and Hindi (the most widely spoken Indian language), by injecting domain knowledge into diverse summarization models. We propose a framework to enhance extractive neural summarization models by incorporating domain-specific pre-trained encoders tailored for legal texts. Further, we explore the injection of legal domain knowledge into generative models (including Large Language Models) through continual pre-training on large legal corpora in English and Hindi. Our proposed approaches achieve statistically significant improvements in both English-to-English and English-to-Hindi Indian legal document summarization, as measured by standard evaluation metrics, factual consistency metrics, and legal domain-specific metrics.

While modern video world models achieve strong performance on intuitive physics benchmarks, it remains unclear which of these representational regimes they implement internally. Here, we present the first interpretability study to directly examine physical representations inside large-scale video encoders. Using layerwise probing, subspace geometry, patch-level decoding, and targeted attention ablations, we characterize where physical information becomes accessible and how it is organized within encoder-based video transformers.\n  Across architectures, we identify a sharp intermediate-depth transition -- which we call the Physics Emergence Zone -- at which physical variables become accessible. Physics-related representations peak shortly after this transition and degrade toward the output layers. Decomposing motion into explicit variables, we find that scalar quantities such as speed and acceleration are available from early layers onwards, whereas motion direction becomes accessible only at the Physics Emergence Zone. Notably, we find that direction is encoded through a high-dimensional population structure with circular geometry, requiring coordinated multi-feature intervention to control. These findings suggest that modern video models do not use factorized representations of physical variables like a classical physics engine. Instead, they use a distributed representation that is nonetheless sufficient for making physical predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7269\u7406\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ee5\u5206\u5e03\u65b9\u5f0f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6025\u5267\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u4e00\u76f4\u5728\u8ba8\u8bba\u89c6\u9891\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5fc5\u987b\u660e\u786e\u5206\u89e3\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u7b49\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u9690\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u6e05\u6670\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\uff08layerwise probing\uff09\u3001\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u7801\uff08patch-level decoding\uff09\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d88\u878d\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u8f6c\u6298\uff08Physics Emergence Zone\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u533a\u57df\u5185\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\u5cf0\u503c\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u5c42\u9010\u6e10\u51cf\u5f31\u3002\u6807\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\uff09\u80fd\u5728\u8f83\u65e9\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u800c\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u5219\u5728\u8be5\u201c\u6d8c\u73b0\u5e26\u201d\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5e03\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u540c\u5e72\u9884\u624d\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u672a\u50cf\u7ecf\u5178\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u90a3\u6837\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u7269\u7406\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u91c7\u7528\u8db3\u591f\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

This work demonstrates that reliable multifingered grasping can be achieved under extremely minimal sensing by relying solely on uniaxial fingertip force feedback and joint proprioception, without vision or multi-axis/tactile sensing. To enable such blind grasping, we employ an efficient teacher-student training pipeline in which a reinforcement-learned teacher exploits privileged simulation-only observations to generate demonstrations for distilling a transformer-based student policy operating under partial observation. The student policy is trained to act using only sensing modalities available at real-world deployment. We validate the proposed approach on real hardware across 18 objects, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution cases, achieving a 98.3~$\\%$ overall grasp success rate.

This research presents Neural Sentinel, a novel unified approach that leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) to perform license plate recognition, state classification, and vehicle attribute extraction through a single forward pass. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating that a fine-tuned PaliGemma 3B model, adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), can simultaneously answer multiple visual questions about vehicle images, achieving 92.3% plate recognition accuracy, which is a 14.1% improvement over EasyOCR and 9.9% improvement over PaddleOCR baselines. We introduce a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) continual learning framework that incorporates user corrections while preventing catastrophic forgetting through experience replay, maintaining a 70:30 ratio of original training data to correction samples. The system achieves a mean inference latency of 152ms with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.048, indicating well calibrated confidence estimates. Additionally, the VLM first architecture enables zero-shot generalization to auxiliary tasks including vehicle color detection (89%), seatbelt detection (82%), and occupancy counting (78%) without task specific training. Through extensive experimentation on real world toll plaza imagery, we demonstrate that unified vision language approaches represent a paradigm shift in ALPR systems, offering superior accuracy, reduced architectural complexity, and emergent multi-task capabilities that traditional pipeline approaches cannot achieve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u81ea\u52a8\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ALPR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b8c\u6210\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5dde\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u5c5e\u6027\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfALPR\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b+OCR\uff09\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u4ee5\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u590d\u6742\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7VLM\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u517c\u5bb9\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aNeural Sentinel\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u8fc7LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684PaliGemma 3B\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u8f66\u8f86\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u95ee\u7b54\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u56de\u653e\u7ed3\u5408\u7528\u6237\u4fee\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u752870:30\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9632\u6b62\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6536\u8d39\u7ad9\u5f71\u50cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe92.3%\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6bd4EasyOCR\u548cPaddleOCR\u63d0\u9ad814.1%\u548c9.9%\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ec5152ms\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.048\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u989c\u8272\u3001\u662f\u5426\u7cfb\u5b89\u5168\u5e26\u3001\u4e58\u5458\u8ba1\u6570\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe89%\u300182%\u300178%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b80\u5355\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5177\u5907\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u968f\u5230\u968f\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9884\u793a\u7740\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u9886\u57df\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Safe locomotion in these settings requires long-horizon goal progress, passability over uneven terrain and static constraints, and collision avoidance against high-speed dynamic obstacles. A single system cannot fully satisfy all three objectives simultaneously: planning-based decisions can be too slow, while purely reactive decisions can sacrifice goal progress and passability. To resolve this conflict, we propose UEREBot (Unstructured-Environment Reflexive Evasion Robot), a hierarchical framework that separates slow planning from instantaneous reflexive evasion and coordinates them during execution. UEREBot formulates the task as a constrained optimal control problem blueprint. It adopts a spatial--temporal planner that provides reference guidance toward the goal and threat signals. It then uses a threat-aware handoff to fuse navigation and reflex actions into a nominal command, and a control barrier function shield as a final execution safeguard. We evaluate UEREBot in Isaac Lab simulation and deploy it on a Unitree Go2 quadruped equipped with onboard perception.

We ask a concrete question: when the generation paradigm is changed but the agent framework and supervision are held fixed, do diffusion backbones induce systematically different planning and tool-use behaviors, and do these differences translate into end-to-end efficiency gains? We study this in a controlled setting by instantiating DLLM and AR backbones within the same agent workflow (DeepDiver) and performing matched agent-oriented fine-tuning on the same trajectory data, yielding diffusion-backed DLLM Agents and directly comparable AR agents. Across benchmarks and case studies, we find that, at comparable accuracy, DLLM Agents are on average over 30% faster end to end than AR agents, with some cases exceeding 8x speedup. Conditioned on correct task completion, DLLM Agents also require fewer interaction rounds and tool invocations, consistent with higher planner hit rates that converge earlier to a correct action path with less backtracking. We further identify two practical considerations for deploying diffusion backbones in tool-using agents. First, naive DLLM policies are more prone to structured tool-call failures, necessitating stronger tool-call-specific training to emit valid schemas and arguments. Second, for multi-turn inputs interleaving context and action spans, diffusion-style span corruption requires aligned attention masking to avoid spurious context-action information flow; without such alignment, performance degrades. Finally, we analyze attention dynamics across workflow stages and observe paradigm-specific coordination patterns, suggesting stronger global planning signals in diffusion-backed agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\uff08DLLM\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08AR\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0DLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb30%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u751a\u81f3\u5feb8\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6269\u6563\u578b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u884c\u4e3a\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u8981\u7d20\u4e0d\u53d8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u6548\u7387\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u642d\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff08DeepDiver\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528DLLM\u548cAR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u4e4b\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u80fd\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0cDLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5e73\u5747\u5feb30%\uff0c\u4e2a\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u5feb8\u500d\u3002DLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f6e\u6b21\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u4e5f\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u5212\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u56de\u6eaf\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u5230DLLM\u9700\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u548cSpan\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u906e\u7f69\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u6548\u679c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0DLLM\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8ba1\u5212\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u548c\u8de8Span\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Traditional systems, however, rely on subject-mounted markers that require manual registration, may shift during procedures, and can cause discomfort. We introduce and evaluate markerless approaches that replace expensive hardware and physical markers with low-cost visible and infrared light cameras incorporating stereo and depth sensing combined with algorithmic modeling of the facial geometry. Validation with $50$ human subjects yielded a median tracking discrepancy of only $2.32$ mm and $2.01\u00b0$ for the best markerless algorithms compared to a conventional marker-based system, which indicates sufficient accuracy for transcranial magnetic stimulation and a substantial improvement over prior markerless results. The results suggest that integration of the data from the various camera sensors can improve the overall accuracy further. The proposed markerless neuronavigation methods can reduce setup cost and complexity, improve patient comfort, and expand access to neuronavigation in clinical and research settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u795e\u7ecf\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u9762\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u4eea\u5668\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u572850\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u5728\u5934\u90e8\u5b89\u88c5\u7269\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u914d\u51c6\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u79fb\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u590d\u6742\u3001\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u5f71\u54cd\u75c5\u4eba\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6025\u9700\u66f4\u7b80\u4fbf\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u8212\u9002\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916\u6df1\u5ea6\u76f8\u673a\uff08\u5177\u5907\u7acb\u4f53\u6216\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4eba\u8138\u51e0\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u3002\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u6807\u8bb0\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u572850\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u4f73\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8bef\u5dee\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4ec5\u4e3a2.32 mm\u548c2.01\u00b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u6807\u8bb0\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\u5df2\u8fbe\u5230\u7ecf\u9885\u78c1\u523a\u6fc0\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ee5\u5f80\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u795e\u7ecf\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u60a3\u8005\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0e\u79d1\u7814\u4e2d\u63a8\u5e7f\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

However, in long-horizon tasks, visually similar observations often recur across execution stages while requiring distinct actions, which leads to ambiguous predictions when policies are conditioned only on instantaneous observations, termed multi-modal action ambiguity (MA2). To address this challenge, we propose the Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP), a simple yet effective diffusion-based framework that explicitly conditions action generation on the robot's execution history. TF-DP represents historical motion as an explicit execution trace and projects it into the visual observation space, providing stage-aware context when current observations alone are insufficient. In addition, the induced trace-focused field emphasizes task-relevant regions associated with historical motion, improving robustness to background visual disturbances. We evaluate TF-DP on real-world robotic manipulation tasks exhibiting pronounced multi-modal action ambiguity and visually cluttered conditions. Experimental results show that TF-DP improves temporal consistency and robustness, outperforming the vanilla diffusion policy by 80.56 percent on tasks with multi-modal action ambiguity and by 86.11 percent under visual disturbances, while maintaining inference efficiency with only a 6.4 percent runtime increase. These results demonstrate that execution-trace conditioning offers a scalable and principled approach for robust long-horizon robotic manipulation within a single policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684Trace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5386\u53f2\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6b67\u4e49\uff08MA2\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6b63\u786e\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6b67\u4e49\uff08MA2\uff09\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTrace-Focused Diffusion Policy (TF-DP)\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u8d77\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528trace-focused field\u5f3a\u5316\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u8fd0\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTF-DP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u7684diffusion policy\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6b67\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534780.56%\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u63d0\u534786.11%\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u67656.4%\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u957f\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0cTF-DP\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u800c\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, the conventional SFT process, driven by Cross-Entropy (CE) loss, often induces mode collapse, where models over-concentrate on specific response patterns. This lack of distributional diversity severely restricts the exploration efficiency required for subsequent RL. While recent studies have attempted to improve SFT by replacing the CE loss, aiming to preserve diversity or refine the update policy, they fail to adequately balance diversity and accuracy, thereby yielding suboptimal performance after RL. To address the mode collapse problem, we propose SED-SFT, which adaptively encourages diversity based on the token exploration space. This framework introduces a selective entropy regularization term with a selective masking mechanism into the optimization objective. Extensive experiments across eight mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that SED-SFT significantly enhances generation diversity with a negligible computational overhead increase compared with CE loss, yielding average improvements of 2.06 and 1.20 points in subsequent RL performance over standard CE-based baselines on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct, respectively.

However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it analytically computes the desired robot behavior while simultaneously ''imagining'' the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity and adaptation, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge beyond a threshold. Across seven simulated tasks and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art baselines, while offering considerably faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u8eab\u72b6\u6001\u6d41\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6a21\u578bK-UBM\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u53ef\u5728\u7ebf\u91cd\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548cTransformer\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u9636\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3001\u7b97\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u6307\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u7528\u5b9a\u957faction\u7247\u6bb5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6296\u52a8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u7075\u654f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faUBM\uff0c\u5c06\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9-\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u8054\u5408\u6d41\u7684\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5f15\u5165Koopman-UBM\uff0c\u501f\u52a9Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u540c\u5d4c\u5165\u9012\u63a8\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6574\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u65f6\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u9884\u671f\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u5728\u7ebf\u518d\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u518d\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u57287\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u548c2\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cK-UBM\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63a8\u65ad\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u66f4\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u906e\u6321\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3002", "conclusion": "UBM\u6846\u67b6\u5c24\u5176K-UBM\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7075\u5de7\u64cd\u4f5c\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We introduce a systematic evaluation framework designed to diagnose and quantify the cross-cultural robustness of state-of-the-art VLMs across multilingual meme datasets, analyzing three axes: (i) learning strategy (zero-shot vs. one-shot), (ii) prompting language (native vs. English), and (iii) translation effects on meaning and detection. Results show that the common ``translate-then-detect'' approach deteriorate performance, while culturally aligned interventions - native-language prompting and one-shot learning - significantly enhance detection.

Despite recent progress, unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models remains challenging due to high computational costs and the difficulty of balancing effective forgetting with retention of unrelated concepts. We introduce FADE (Fast Adapter for Data Erasure), a two-stage unlearning method for image generation that combines parameter localization with self-distillation. FADE first identifies parameters most responsible for the forget set using gradient-based saliency and constrains updates through sparse LoRA adapters, ensuring lightweight, localized modifications. In a second stage, FADE applies a self-distillation objective that overwrites the forgotten concept with a user-defined surrogate while preserving behavior on retained data. The resulting adapters are memory-efficient, reversible, and can be merged or removed at runtime, enabling flexible deployment in production systems. We evaluated FADE on the UnlearnCanvas benchmark and conducted ablation studies on Imagenette, Labeled Faces in the Wild, AtharvaTaras Dog Breeds Dataset, and SUN Attributes datasets, demonstrating State-of-the-Art unlearning performance with fine-grained control over the forgetting-retention trade-off.

Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms unimodal baselines in naturalness, emotional clarity, and modal coherence, advancing socially expressive humanoid robotics for diverse real-world environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SeM^2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e14\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u53ca\u624b\u52bf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e91\u7aef\u548c\u672c\u5730\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6570\u4eff\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u548c\u80a2\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u534f\u8c03\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u77ed\u677f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8131\u79bb\u4e91\u7aef\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684SeM^2\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u7528\u6237\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u3001\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u751f\u6210\u4e92\u52a8\u8ba1\u5212\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5e8f\u5217\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\uff08\u534f\u8c03\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u65f6\u5e8f\uff09\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u4e91\u7aef\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e24\u79cd\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u8fb9\u7f18\u7248\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u5347\u672c\u5730\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fb9\u7f18\u7248\u4fdd\u7559\u4e8695%\u7684\u4e91\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SeM^2\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u60c5\u611f\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Human evaluation confirms the fundamental trade-off between simplification effectiveness and meaning preservation.

Today, the share of non-metallic inclusions (contamination) is judged visually by inspectors - an approach that is subjective and hazardous due to dust and moving machinery. We present an assistive computer vision pipeline that estimates contamination (per percent) from images captured during railcar unloading and also classifies scrap type. The method formulates contamination assessment as a regression task at the railcar level and leverages sequential data through multi-instance learning (MIL) and multi-task learning (MTL). Best results include MAE 0.27 and R2 0.83 by MIL; and an MTL setup reaches MAE 0.36 with F1 0.79 for scrap class. Also we present the system in near real time within the acceptance workflow: magnet/railcar detection segments temporal layers, a versioned inference service produces railcar-level estimates with confidence scores, and results are reviewed by operators with structured overrides; corrections and uncertain cases feed an active-learning loop for continual improvement. The pipeline reduces subjective variability, improves human safety, and enables integration into acceptance and melt-planning workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u534f\u52a9\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e9f\u94a2\u6c61\u67d3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u94a2\u94c1\u5236\u9020\u4e2d\u7684\u5e9f\u94a2\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u94a2\u94c1\u5236\u9020\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e9f\u94a2\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u91d1\u5c5e\u5939\u6742\u6c61\u67d3\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u8017\u3001\u6392\u653e\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u9760\u4eba\u5de5\u76ee\u6d4b\u5224\u65ad\u6c61\u67d3\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u4f5c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u5371\u9669\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e9f\u94a2\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u610f\u4e49\u91cd\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5378\u8f7d\u5e9f\u94a2\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c61\u67d3\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u5e9f\u94a2\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MIL\uff09\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MTL\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4f30\u8ba1\u6c61\u67d3\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u63a5\u6536\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MIL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c61\u67d3\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.27\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff09\u548c0.83\u7684R2\u503c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MTL\uff09\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1MAE\u4e3a0.36\uff0c\u5206\u7c7bF1\u503c\u4e3a0.79\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u5de5\u7ea0\u504f\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3b\u89c2\u5224\u65ad\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f5c\u4e1a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u63a5\u6536\u4e0e\u7194\u70bc\u8ba1\u5212\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5bf9\u94a2\u94c1\u5e9f\u6599\u7ba1\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, existing controllers are commonly driven either by predefined motion trajectories, which offer limited flexibility when user intent changes, or by continuous human teleoperation, which requires constant human involvement and limits autonomy. This work addresses the problem of how to drive a universal humanoid controller in a real-time and interactive manner. We present TextOp, a real-time text-driven humanoid motion generation and control framework that supports streaming language commands and on-the-fly instruction modification during execution. TextOp adopts a two-level architecture in which a high-level autoregressive motion diffusion model continuously generates short-horizon kinematic trajectories conditioned on the current text input, while a low-level motion tracking policy executes these trajectories on a physical humanoid robot. By bridging interactive motion generation with robust whole-body control, TextOp unlocks free-form intent expression and enables smooth transitions across multiple challenging behaviors such as dancing and jumping, within a single continuous motion execution. Extensive real-robot experiments and offline evaluations demonstrate instant responsiveness, smooth whole-body motion, and precise control.

When the length is unknown, as in realistic completion and infilling, naively comparing confidence across mask lengths becomes systematically biased, leading to under-generation or redundant continuations. In this paper, we show that this failure arises from an intrinsic lengthinduced bias in generation confidence estimates, leaving existing DLLMs without a robust way to determine generation length and making variablelength inference unreliable. To address this issue, we propose LR-DLLM, a length-regularized inference framework for DLLMs that treats generation length as an explicit variable and achieves reliable length determination at inference time. It decouples semantic compatibility from lengthinduced uncertainty through an explicit length regularization that corrects biased confidence estimates. Based on this, LR-DLLM enables dynamic expansion or contraction of the generation span without modifying the underlying DLLM or its training procedure. Experiments show that LRDLLM achieves 51.3% Pass@1 on HumanEvalInfilling under fully unknown lengths (+13.4% vs. DreamOn) and 51.5% average Pass@1 on four-language McEval (+14.3% vs. DreamOn).", "AI": {"tldr": "DLLM \u56fa\u6709\u5730\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u53d8\u957f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08LR-DLLM\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5ea6\u672a\u77e5\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d Diffusion Large Language Models\uff08DLLMs\uff09\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u957f\u5ea6\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u6587\u672c\u8865\u5168\u3001\u63d2\u5165\u7b49\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83 mask \u957f\u5ea6\u65f6\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u5c11\u6216\u91cd\u590d\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u81ea\u4e3b\u5224\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08LR-DLLM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u6d88\u9664\u7531\u957f\u5ea6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u3002LR-DLLM \u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5e95\u5c42 DLLM \u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "result": "\u5728 HumanEvalInfilling\uff08\u957f\u5ea6\u672a\u77e5\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cLR-DLLM Pass@1 \u8fbe\u5230 51.3%\uff08\u6bd4 DreamOn \u63d0\u9ad8 13.4%\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00 McEval \u4e0a\u5e73\u5747 Pass@1 \u8fbe\u5230 51.5%\uff08\u6bd4 DreamOn \u63d0\u9ad8 14.3%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "LR-DLLM \u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86 DLLM \u5728\u53d8\u957f\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u5224\u5b9a\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347 DLLM \u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u53d8\u957f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing progress in humanoid facial expression imitation remains limited, often failing to achieve either real-time performance or realistic expressiveness due to offline video-based inference designs and insufficient ability to capture and transfer subtle expression details. To address these limitations, we present VividFace, a real-time and realistic facial expression shadowing system for humanoid robots. An optimized imitation framework X2CNet++ enhances expressiveness by fine-tuning the human-to-humanoid facial motion transfer module and introducing a feature-adaptation training strategy for better alignment across different image sources. Real-time shadowing is further enabled by a video-stream-compatible inference pipeline and a streamlined workflow based on asynchronous I/O for efficient communication across devices.

However, despite powerful generation ability, LLMs remain weak at verifying their own answers, revealing a persistent capability asymmetry between generation and self-verification. In this work, we conduct an in-depth investigation of this asymmetry throughout training evolution and show that, even on the same task, improving generation does not lead to corresponding improvements in self-verification. Interestingly, we find that the reverse direction of this asymmetry behaves differently: learning to self-verify can effectively improve generation performance, achieving accuracy comparable to standard generation training while yielding more efficient and effective reasoning traces. Building on this observation, we further explore integrating self-verification into generation training by formulating a multi-task reinforcement learning framework, where generation and self-verification are optimized as two independent but complementary objectives. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models demonstrate performance gains over generation-only training in both generation and verification capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u72ec\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5374\u5728\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff08\u68c0\u67e5\u81ea\u8eab\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4f46\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5355\u72ec\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u53ea\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u3002\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u6574\u4f53\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches to the assessment of image displacement and non-contact material probing typically rely on time-consuming iterative algorithms for non-rigid image registration and constitutive modelling using discretization and iterative numerical solving techniques, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM), which are not suitable for high-throughput data processing. Here, we present an efficient deep learning based end-to-end approach for the estimation of continuum displacement and material compressibility directly from the image series. Based on two deep neural networks for image registration and material compressibility estimation, this framework outperforms conventional approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. In particular, our experimental results show that the deep learning model trained on a set of reference data can accurately determine the material compressibility even in the presence of substantial local deviations of the mapping predicted by image registration from the reference displacement field. Our findings suggest that the remarkable accuracy of the deep learning end-to-end model originates from its ability to assess higher-order cognitive features, such as the vorticity of the vector field, rather than conventional local features of the image displacement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4ece\u5149\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4f30\u7b97\u7269\u7406\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4d\u79fb\u548c\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u6750\u6599\u63a2\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u6709\u9650\u5143\u6cd5\u548c\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6cd5\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u76f4\u63a5\u7269\u7406\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u4e0e\u6750\u6599\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u4f30\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6750\u6599\u673a\u68b0\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u8bba\u5728\u6548\u7387\u8fd8\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u4f4d\u79fb\u573a\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u5c40\u90e8\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u6750\u6599\u7684\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u77e2\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u9ad8\u9636\u8ba4\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u6da1\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8fd9\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u975e\u63a5\u89e6\u5f0f\u5149\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u4ecb\u8d28\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with this form of task-level reasoning. They either depend on prompt-based in-context decomposition, which is unstable and sensitive to linguistic variations, or end-to-end long-horizon training, which requires large-scale demonstrations and entangles task-level reasoning with low-level control. We present in-parameter structured task reasoning (iSTAR), a framework for enhancing VLA models via functional differentiation induced by in-parameter structural reasoning. Instead of treating VLAs as monolithic policies, iSTAR embeds task-level semantic structure directly into model parameters, enabling differentiated task-level inference without external planners or handcrafted prompt inputs. This injected structure takes the form of implicit dynamic scene-graph knowledge that captures object relations, subtask semantics, and task-level dependencies in parameter space. Across diverse manipulation benchmarks, iSTAR achieves more reliable task decompositions and higher success rates than both in-context and end-to-end VLA baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of parameter-space structural reasoning for functional differentiation and improved generalization across task variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6iSTAR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5185\u5d4c\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0ciSTAR\u5728\u591a\u9879\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684prompt\u5206\u89e3\u6216\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faiSTAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u76f4\u63a5\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u8c61\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5316\u5206\u5316\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8planner\u6216\u4eba\u5de5prompt\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0ciSTAR\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56prompt\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aefVLA\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "iSTAR\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose Bird-SR, a bidirectional reward-guided diffusion framework that formulates super-resolution as trajectory-level preference optimization via reward feedback learning (ReFL), jointly leveraging synthetic LR-HR pairs and real-world LR images. For structural fidelity easily affected in ReFL, the model is directly optimized on synthetic pairs at early diffusion steps, which also facilitates structure preservation for real-world inputs under smaller distribution gap in structure levels. For perceptual enhancement, quality-guided rewards are applied at later sampling steps to both synthetic and real LR images. To mitigate reward hacking, the rewards for synthetic results are formulated in a relative advantage space bounded by their clean counterparts, while real-world optimization is regularized via a semantic alignment constraint. Furthermore, to balance structural and perceptual learning, we adopt a dynamic fidelity-perception weighting strategy that emphasizes structure preservation at early stages and progressively shifts focus toward perceptual optimization at later diffusion steps.

Unlike humans, a physical robot can simultaneously present different identities and have them reside and control different parts of the robot. This paper presents a novel study that investigates how users perceive a robot where different robot control domains (head and gripper) are presented as independent robots. We conducted a mixed design study where participants experienced one of three presentations: a single robot, two agents with shared full control (co-embodiment), or two agents with split control across robot control domains (split-embodiment). Participants underwent three distinct tasks -- a mundane data entry task where the robot provides motivational support, an individual sorting task with isolated robot failures, and a collaborative arrangement task where the robot causes a failure that directly affects the human participant. Participants perceived the robot as residing in the different control domains and were able to associate robot failure with different identities.

Prior works on LLM-based tutoring typically learn a single tutor policy and do not capture the diversity of tutoring styles. In real-world tutor-student interactions, pedagogical intent is realized through adaptive instructional strategies, with tutors varying the level of scaffolding, instructional directiveness, feedback, and affective support in response to learners' needs. These differences can all impact dialogue dynamics and student engagement. In this paper, we explore how tutor personas embedded in human tutor-student dialogues can be used to guide LLM behavior without relying on explicitly prompted instructions. We modify Bidirectional Preference Optimization (BiPO) to learn a steering vector, an activation-space direction that steers model responses towards certain tutor personas. We find that this steering vector captures tutor-specific variation across dialogue contexts, improving semantic alignment with ground-truth tutor utterances and increasing preference-based evaluations, while largely preserving lexical similarity. Analysis of the learned directional coefficients further reveals interpretable structure across tutors, corresponding to consistent differences in tutoring behavior. These results demonstrate that activation steering offers an effective and interpretable way for controlling tutor-specific variation in LLMs using signals derived directly from human dialogue data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\uff08steering vector\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u8f85\u5bfc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfc\u5e08\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f80\u5f80\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u5355\u4e00\u5bfc\u5e08\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u6559\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfc\u5e08\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u5b66\u751f\u9700\u6c42\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u53cd\u9988\u65b9\u5f0f\u7b49\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u4f53\u9a8c\u4e0e\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9LLM\u5c55\u73b0\u591a\u5143\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u8f85\u5bfc\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u771f\u4eba\u5bfc\u5e08\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u5e08\u4eba\u8bbe\uff08persona\uff09\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165LLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdbBiPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u51fa\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\uff08steering vector\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfc\u5e08\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0csteering vector \u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfc\u5e08\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5bfc\u5e08\u8bdd\u8bed\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u5951\u5408\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u66f4\u9ad8\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u6574\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u98ce\u683c\u672a\u53d7\u5230\u660e\u663e\u7834\u574f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5730\u8c03\u63a7LLM\u5c55\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u4eba\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u70bc\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5bfc\u5e08\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The expert is first trained with privileged state information, inducing a latent space sufficient for control, after which its latent interface and action head are frozen. A lightweight adapter is then trained to map raw visual-language observations, via a frozen vision-language model, into the expert's latent space, reducing the problem of visuomotor learning to supervised latent alignment rather than end-to-end policy optimization. This decoupling enforces a stable contract between perception and control, enabling expert behavior to be reused across sensing modalities and environmental variations. We instantiate LCLA and evaluate it on a vision-language indoor navigation task, where aligned latent spaces yield strong in-distribution performance and robust zero-shot generalization to unseen environments, lighting conditions, and viewpoints while remaining lightweight at inference time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6LCLA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u901a\u5e38\u7d27\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5e7b\u60f3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7b80\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u7528\u6709\u7279\u6743\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u5145\u8db3\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u51bb\u7ed3\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u7531\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u89c2\u6d4b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u611f\u77e5-\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u77e5\u8bc6\u91cd\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u5757\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cLCLA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0b\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5149\u7167\u53ca\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LCLA\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

However, LLM judges show biases for length and order among others, and are vulnerable to various adversarial input prompts. While recent studies have looked into these biases, few have analyzed them at a more granular level in relation to a well-defined overlap metric. In this work we provide an LLM judge bias analysis as a function of overlap with human-written responses in the domain of summarization. We test 9 recent LLMs with parameter counts ranging from 1 billion to 12 billion, including variants of Gemma 3 and LLaMA 3. We find that LLM judges increasingly prefer summaries generated by other LLMs over those written by humans as the similarities (as measured by ROUGE and BLEU) between the judged summaries decrease, and this pattern extends to all but one model tested, and exists regardless of the models' own position biases. Additionally, we find that models struggle to judge even summaries with limited overlaps, suggesting that LLM-as-a-judge in the summary domain should rely on techniques beyond a simple comparison.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5bf9LLM\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u76f8\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u6458\u8981\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6587\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\u660e\u663e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6307\u6807\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5176\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u6539\u5199\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5176\u5177\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u81f4\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u9009\u53d6\u4e869\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u91cf1\u4ebf\u81f3120\u4ebf\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u4e2aGemma 3\u548cLLaMA 3\u53d8\u79cd\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6458\u8981\u91cd\u53e0\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5224\u522b\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528ROUGE\u548cBLEU\u7b49\u91cd\u53e0\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6458\u8981\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\uff0cLLM\u8bc4\u5ba1\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6458\u8981\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u8d8b\u52bf\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u89c1\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cLLM\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5bf9\u4f4e\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u6458\u8981\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5ba1\u64c5\u957f\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f4e\u6587\u672c\u91cd\u53e0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u504f\u597d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6458\u8981\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u5176\u4ed6\u8bc4\u5ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5ba2\u89c2\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{WorldEdit}, a dataset specifically designed to enable world-driven image editing. WorldEdit consists of high-quality editing samples, guided by paraphrased instructions that align with real-world causal logic. Furthermore, we provide \\textbf{WorldEdit-Test} for evaluating the existing model's performance on causal editing scenarios. With WorldEdit, we use a two-stage training framework for fine-tuning models like Bagel, integrating with a causal verification reward.

The ATUGV is a multi-body system with mobile robots that can be used to power the ATUGV morphable motion, powered cells to enclose the mobile robots, unpowered cells to contain payloads, and a deformable structure to integrate cells through bars and joints. The objective is that all powered and unpowered cells motion can safely track a desired affine transformation, where an affine transformation can be decomposed into translation, rigid body rotation, and deformation. To this end, the paper first uses a deep neural network to structure cell interconnection in such a way that every cell can freely move over the deformation plane, and the entire structure can reconfigurably deform to track a desired affine transformation. Then, the mobile robots, contained by the powered cells and stepper motors, regulating the connections of the powered and unpowered cells, design the proper controls so that all cells safely track the desired affine transformation. The functionality of the proposed ATUGV is validated through hardware experimentation and simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\uff08ATUGV\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u643a\u5e26\u591a\u4e2a\u8f7d\u8377\u65f6\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u643a\u5e26\u591a\u8f7d\u8377\u548c\u53d8\u5f62\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u8f7d\u8377\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e14\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edfATUGV\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5355\u5143\u3001\u52a8\u529b/\u65e0\u52a8\u529b\u8f7d\u8377\u5355\u5143\u53ca\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5355\u5143\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u5355\u5143\u80fd\u5171\u540c\u884c\u8fdb\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u6b65\u8fdb\u7535\u673a\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u5404\u5355\u5143\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f8\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b89\u5168\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u5f62\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ATUGV\u80fd\u591f\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6240\u9700\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u8f7d\u8377\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u8f93\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ATUGV\u7ed3\u6784\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u643a\u8f7d\u591a\u8f7d\u8377\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u65e0\u4eba\u5730\u9762\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We introduce SRR-Judge, a framework for reliable step-level assessment of reasoning and search actions. Integrated into a modified ReAct-style rate-and-refine workflow, SRR-Judge provides fine-grained guidance for search-integrated reasoning and enables efficient post-training annotation. Using SRR-annotated data, we apply an iterative rejection sampling fine-tuning procedure to enhance the deep search capability of the base agent. Empirically, SRR-Judge delivers more reliable step-level evaluations than much larger models such as DeepSeek-V3.1, with its ratings showing strong correlation with final answer correctness.

However, existing approaches operate in raster space and rely on post hoc vectorization, which introduces structural inconsistencies and hinders end-to-end learning. Motivated by compositional spatial reasoning, we propose TLC-Plan, a hierarchical generative model that directly synthesizes vector floorplans from input boundaries, aligning with human architectural workflows based on modular and reusable patterns. TLC-Plan employs a two-level VQ-VAE to encode global layouts as semantically labeled room bounding boxes and to refine local geometries using polygon-level codes. This hierarchy is unified in a CodeTree representation, while an autoregressive transformer samples codes conditioned on the boundary to generate diverse and topologically valid designs, without requiring explicit room topology or dimensional priors. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance on RPLAN dataset (FID = 1.84, MSE = 2.06) and leading results on LIFULL dataset.

Recognizing symmetrical features or axes within an object helps in developing efficient grasp strategies, as grasping along these axes typically results in a more stable and balanced grip, thereby facilitating successful manipulation. This paper employs geometrical moments to identify symmetries and estimate orthogonal transformations, including rotations and mirror transformations, for objects centered at the frame origin. It provides distinctive metrics for detecting symmetries and estimating orthogonal transformations, encompassing rotations, reflections, and their combinations. A comprehensive methodology is developed to obtain these functions in n-dimensional space, specifically moment \\( n \\)-tuples.

Existing approaches rely on heuristic methods such as selecting recent interactions or prompting summarization models to compress user profiles. However, these methods treat context as a monolithic whole and fail to consider how LLMs internally process and prioritize different profile components. We investigate whether LLMs' attention patterns can effectively identify important personalization signals for intelligent context compression. Through preliminary studies on representative personalization tasks, we discover that (a) LLMs' attention patterns naturally reveal important signals, and (b) fine-tuning enhances LLMs' ability to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information. Based on these insights, we propose Attn-GS, an attention-guided context compression framework that leverages attention feedback from a marking model to mark important personalization sentences, then guides a compression model to generate task-relevant, high-quality compressed user contexts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Attn-GS significantly outperforms various baselines across different tasks, token limits, and settings, achieving performance close to using full context while reducing token usage by 50 times.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11token\u7528\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u753b\u50cf\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165token\u6570\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6162\u4e14API\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u606f\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u7ec6\u81f4\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u6790LLM\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5929\u751f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u522b\u76f8\u5173\u4e0e\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faAttn-GS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53e5\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u518d\u5f15\u5bfc\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u7684\u7528\u6237\u538b\u7f29context\u3002", "result": "Attn-GS\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u3001token\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728token\u7528\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1150\u500d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u53d6\u5f97\u4e0e\u5168\u91cfcontext\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6ce8\u91cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u591f\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u538b\u7f29LLM\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0cAttn-GS\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

While 3D Gaussian Splatting enables photorealistic scene reconstruction from real-world data, existing methods inherently couple static lighting with geometry, severely limiting policy generalization to dynamic real-world illumination. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end reinforcement learning framework designed for effective zero-shot transfer to unstructured outdoors. Within a high-fidelity simulation grounded in real-world data, our policy is trained to map raw monocular RGB observations directly to continuous control commands. To overcome photometric limitations, we introduce Relightable 3D Gaussian Splatting, which decomposes scene components to enable explicit, physically grounded editing of environmental lighting within the neural representation. By augmenting training with diverse synthesized lighting conditions ranging from strong directional sunlight to diffuse overcast skies, we compel the policy to learn robust, illumination-invariant visual features.

A key challenge in this decentralized setting is perceptual misalignment across robots, where viewpoint differences and language ambiguity can yield inconsistent interpretations and degrade cooperative transport. To mitigate this problem, we adopt a dependent leader-follower design, where one robot serves as the leader and the other as the follower. Although such a leader-follower structure appears straightforward, learning with independent and symmetric agents often yields symmetric or unstable behaviors without explicit inductive biases. To address this challenge, we propose Consistent Leader-Follower (CoLF), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for stable leader-follower role differentiation. CoLF consists of two key components: (1) an asymmetric policy design that induces leader-follower role differentiation, and (2) a mutual-information-based training objective that maximizes a variational lower bound, encouraging the follower to predict the leader's action from its local observation.

While recent work has identified structured, human-like conceptual representations within these models, it remains unclear whether they functionally rely on such representations for reasoning. Here we investigate the internal processing of LLMs during in-context concept inference. Our results reveal a conceptual subspace emerging in middle to late layers, whose representational structure persists across contexts. Using causal mediation analyses, we demonstrate that this subspace is not merely an epiphenomenon but is functionally central to model predictions, establishing its causal role in inference. We further identify a layer-wise progression where attention heads in early-to-middle layers integrate contextual cues to construct and refine the subspace, which is subsequently leveraged by later layers to generate predictions. Together, these findings provide evidence that LLMs dynamically construct and use structured, latent representations in context for inference, offering insights into the computational processes underlying flexible adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u4f1a\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eLLM\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u529f\u80fd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bd5\u56fe\u63ed\u793aLLM\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5bf9LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8fd0\u7528\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5176\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e2d\u95f4\u81f3\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u201c\u6982\u5ff5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u201d\uff0c\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u7ec8\u63a8\u65ad\u7ed3\u679c\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u65e9\u4e2d\u671f\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4f1a\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u6784\u5efa\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u5219\u4ee5\u6b64\u4ea7\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4f1a\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5177\u5907\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

When MLLMs reason over camera-captured views of the physical world, a new attack surface emerges: an attacker can place text-bearing physical objects in the environment to override MLLMs' intended task. While prior work has studied prompt injection in the text domain and through digitally edited 2D images, it remains unclear how these attacks function in 3D physical environments. To bridge the gap, we introduce PI3D, a prompt injection attack against MLLMs in 3D environments, realized through text-bearing physical object placement rather than digital image edits. We formulate and solve the problem of identifying an effective 3D object pose (position and orientation) with injected text, where the attacker's goal is to induce the MLLM to perform the injected task while ensuring that the object placement remains physically plausible. Experiments demonstrate that PI3D is an effective attack against multiple MLLMs under diverse camera trajectories. We further evaluate existing defenses and show that they are insufficient to defend against PI3D.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff08PI3D\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u653e\u7f6e\u5e26\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6297\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740MLLMs\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4f53\u7b493D\u89c6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u666e\u53ca\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u611f\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u5927\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u653b\u51fb\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u62162D\u56fe\u7247\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u771f\u5b9e3D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u4f3c\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faPI3D\u653b\u51fb\uff1a\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6709\u610f\u8bc6\u5730\u5c06\u5d4c\u5165\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4ee5\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u653e\u5165\u771f\u5b9e\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u8ba9MLLM\u5b8c\u6210\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u671d\u5411\u63d0\u51fa\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u653e\u7f6e\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u8def\u5f84\u4e0b\u68c0\u9a8c\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e38\u89c1\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPI3D\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41MLLM\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u62cd\u6444\u8def\u5f84\u4e0b\u5747\u6210\u529f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3b\u6d41\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\u96be\u4ee5\u963b\u6b62\u6b64\u7c7b\u7269\u7406\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "MLLMs\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5e38\u89c4\u9632\u5fa1\u96be\u4ee5\u62b5\u5fa1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5bf9\u6297\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u653b\u51fb\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Unlike simulation, real-world systems cannot be arbitrarily accelerated, cheaply reset, or massively replicated, which makes scalable data collection, heterogeneous deployment, and long-horizon effective training difficult. These challenges suggest that real-world policy learning is not only an algorithmic issue but fundamentally a systems problem. We present USER, a Unified and extensible SystEm for Real-world online policy learning. USER treats physical robots as first-class hardware resources alongside GPUs through a unified hardware abstraction layer, enabling automatic discovery, management, and scheduling of heterogeneous robots. To address cloud-edge communication, USER introduces an adaptive communication plane with tunneling-based networking, distributed data channels for traffic localization, and streaming-multiprocessor-aware weight synchronization to regulate GPU-side overhead. On top of this infrastructure, USER organizes learning as a fully asynchronous framework with a persistent, cache-aware buffer, enabling efficient long-horizon experiments with robust crash recovery and reuse of historical data. In addition, USER provides extensible abstractions for rewards, algorithms, and policies, supporting online imitation or reinforcement learning of CNN/MLP, generative policies, and large vision-language-action (VLA) models within a unified pipeline. Results in both simulation and the real world show that USER enables multi-robot coordination, heterogeneous manipulators, edge-cloud collaboration with large models, and long-running asynchronous training, offering a unified and extensible systems foundation for real-world online policy learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86USER\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4f7f\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u90e8\u7f72\u96be\u3001\u957f\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u6613\u7b49\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5de5\u7a0b\u96be\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "USER\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0eGPU\u540c\u7b49\u5730\u4f4d\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u7ba1\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u901a\u4fe1\u5c42\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6301\u4e45\u3001\u7f13\u5b58\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u957f\u65f6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6837\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "USER\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u957f\u671f\u5f02\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "USER\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u652f\u6491\uff0c\u4f7f\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6280\u672f\u8d70\u5411\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness in realistic user-engaged agent scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on the effect of explicit thinking in user-engaged LLM agents. Our experiments span across seven models, three benchmarks, and two thinking instantiations, and we evaluate them through both a quantitative response taxonomy analysis and qualitative failure propagation case studies. Contrary to expectations, we find that mandatory thinking often backfires on agents in user-engaged settings, causing anomalous performance degradation across various LLMs. Our key finding reveals that thinking makes agents more ``introverted'' by shortening responses and reducing information disclosure to users, which weakens agent-user information exchange and leads to downstream task failures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicitly prompting for information disclosure reliably improves performance across diverse model families, suggesting that proactive transparency is a vital lever for agent optimization. Overall, our study suggests that information transparency awareness is a crucial yet underexplored perspective for the future design of reasoning agents in real-world scenarios.

A key challenge arises from the representation mismatch between discrete, token-level semantic reasoning in LLMs and the dense, fine-grained temporal dynamics required for 3D facial motion, which makes direct modeling difficult to optimize under limited data. We propose Expressive Omni (Ex-Omni), an open-source omni-modal framework that augments OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Ex-Omni reduces learning difficulty by decoupling semantic reasoning from temporal generation, leveraging speech units as temporal scaffolding and a unified token-as-query gated fusion (TQGF) mechanism for controlled semantic injection. We further introduce InstructEx, a dataset aims to facilitate augment OLLMs with speech-accompanied 3D facial animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ex-Omni performs competitively against existing open-source OLLMs while enabling stable aligned speech and facial animation generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Ex-Omni\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u76843D\u4eba\u8138\u52a8\u753b\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e\u4eba\u8138\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08OLLMs\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u4ea4\u4e92\u975e\u5e38\u5173\u952e\u7684\u201c\u8bed\u97f3\u4e0e3D\u4eba\u8138\u52a8\u753b\u7ed3\u5408\u201d\u4ecd\u9c9c\u6709\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u96be\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e\uff1a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e60\u60ef\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u3001\u57fa\u4e8etoken\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c3D\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faEx-Omni\u5f00\u6e90\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u505a\u6cd5\u4e3a\uff1a\u7528\u8bed\u97f3\u5355\u5143\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u652f\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684token-as-query gated fusion\uff08TQGF\uff09\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u6ce8\u5165\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5efa\u8bbe\u4e86InstructEx\u8bed\u97f3-3D\u4eba\u8138\u52a8\u753b\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8be5\u65b9\u5411\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEx-Omni\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90OLLMs\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u548c\u4eba\u8138\u52a8\u753b\u8054\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "Ex-Omni\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u97f3-3D\u4eba\u8138\u52a8\u753b\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables variable computation, it scales memory linearly and is ill-suited for continuous action spaces. We introduce Recurrent-Depth VLA (RD-VLA), an architecture that achieves computational adaptivity via latent iterative refinement rather than explicit token generation. RD-VLA employs a recurrent, weight-tied action head that supports arbitrary inference depth with a constant memory footprint. The model is trained using truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) to efficiently supervise the refinement process. At inference, RD-VLA dynamically allocates compute using an adaptive stopping criterion based on latent convergence. Experiments on challenging manipulation tasks show that recurrent depth is critical: tasks that fail entirely (0 percent success) with single-iteration inference exceed 90 percent success with four iterations, while simpler tasks saturate rapidly.

Layer-wise pruning, a commonly employed strategy to mitigate inference costs, can partially address this challenge. However, existing approaches generally depend on static heuristic rules and fail to account for the interdependencies among layers, thereby limiting the effectiveness of the pruning process. To this end, this paper proposes a game-theoretic framework that formulates layer pruning as a cooperative game in which each layer acts as a player and model performance serves as the utility. As computing exact Shapley values is computationally infeasible for large language models (LLMs), we propose using a lightweight surrogate network to estimate layer-wise marginal contributions. This network can predict LLM performance for arbitrary layer combinations at a low computational cost. Additionally, we employ stratified Monte Carlo mask sampling to further reduce the cost of Sharpley value estimation. This approach captures inter-layer dependencies and dynamically identifies critical layers for pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method in terms of perplexity and zero-shot accuracy, achieving more efficient and effective layer-wise pruning for large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u8003\u8651\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5c42\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u4f5c\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u89c6\u4e3a\u535a\u5f08\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e3a\u6548\u7528\u3002\u7531\u4e8eShapley\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5c42\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1bmask\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86Shapley\u503c\u4f30\u7b97\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5c42\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u5c42\u7ea7\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u6d4b\u5c42\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

In biplanar X ray guided navigation, such pipelines are widely used due to their real time capability and geometric interpretability. However, navigation reliability can be constrained by an overlooked system level failure mechanism in which installation induced structural perturbations introduced at the perception stage are progressively amplified along the perception reconstruction execution chain and dominate execution level error and tail risk behavior. This paper investigates this mechanism from a system level perspective and presents a unified error propagation modeling framework that characterizes how installation induced structural perturbations propagate and couple with pixel level observation noise through biplanar imaging, projection matrix estimation, triangulation, and coordinate mapping. Using first order analytic uncertainty propagation and Monte Carlo simulations, we analyze dominant sensitivity channels and quantify worst case error behavior beyond mean accuracy metrics. The results show that rotational installation error is a primary driver of system level error amplification, while translational misalignment of comparable magnitude plays a secondary role under typical biplanar geometries. Real biplanar X ray bench top experiments further confirm that the predicted amplification trends persist under realistic imaging conditions. These findings reveal a broader structural limitation of reference based multi stage geometric perception pipelines and provide a framework for system level reliability analysis and risk aware design in safety critical robotic navigation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u53cc\u5e73\u9762X\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5b89\u88c5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u88ab\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7b49\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u7531\u5b89\u88c5\u8bef\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u673a\u5236\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63ed\u793a\u6b64\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u6e90\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b89\u88c5\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5e73\u9762\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u5750\u6807\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8026\u5408\u548c\u653e\u5927\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u9636\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u6700\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u901a\u9053\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u8bef\u5dee\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u88c5\u8bef\u5dee\u662f\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u7b49\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u5178\u578b\u7684\u53cc\u5e73\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u5b9e\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u7406\u8bba\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53c2\u8003\u57fa\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\u653e\u5927\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u672c\u6587\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We probe the hidden states of several smaller open-source LLMs. A single linear projection of an appropriate hidden layer encodes the log-magnitudes of both kinds of numerals, allowing us to recover the numbers with relative error of about 2.3% (on restricted synthetic text) or 19.06% (on scientific papers). Furthermore, the hidden state after reading a pair of numerals encodes their ranking, with a linear classifier achieving over 90% accuracy. Yet surprisingly, when explicitly asked to rank the same pairs of numerals, these LLMs achieve only 50-70% accuracy, with worse performance for models whose probes are less effective. Finally, we show that incorporating the classifier probe's log-loss as an auxiliary objective during finetuning brings an additional 3.22% improvement in verbalized accuracy over base models, demonstrating that improving models' internal magnitude representations can enhance their numerical reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0a\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u5224\u5b9a $5.7 \\times 10^2$ \u4e0e $580$ \u54ea\u4e2a\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86LLM\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u80fd\u4ee5\u8f83\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u5b57\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5f97\u5230\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41LLM\u5e38\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5177\u5907\u5904\u7406\u7b97\u672f\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u5b57\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9891\u9891\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u8bb8\u5e76\u672a\u6df1\u523b\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u5c55\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9009\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u5c0f\u578b\u5f00\u6e90LLM\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u67e5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u89e3\u7801\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u91cf\u7ea7\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5176\u5bf9\u6570\u5b57\u5927\u5c0f\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u6700\u540e\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "(1) \u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u9690\u85cf\u5c42\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u8fd8\u539f\u6570\u5b57\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff1b(2) \u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u53ef\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5730\u7f16\u7801\u6570\u5b57\u5927\u5c0f\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u5f0f\u56de\u7b54\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5374\u4ec5\u670950-70%\uff1b(3) \u52a0\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u76ee\u6807\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u53473.22%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0LLM\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u91cf\u7ea7\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5916\u90e8\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u7684\u6570\u503c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While prior work has sought to mitigate these shifts by using self-supervised regularization with paired longitudinal data, such data are often unavailable in practice. To address this, we propose \\emph{DuMeta++}, a dual meta-learning framework that operates without paired longitudinal data. Our approach integrates: (1) meta-feature learning to extract age-agnostic semantic representations of spatiotemporally evolving brain structures, and (2) meta-initialization learning to enable data-efficient adaptation of the segmentation model. Furthermore, we propose a memory-bank-based class-aware regularization strategy to enforce longitudinal consistency without explicit longitudinal supervision.

By explicitly modeling how image measurement errors propagate through perspective geometry, we derive an error transfer model that characterizes the relationship between feature point distribution, camera depth, and pose estimation uncertainty. Building on this analysis, we develop a pose estimation method that leverages parallel perspective initialization and error-aware weighting within a Gauss-Newton optimization scheme, leading to improved robustness in proximity operations. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real-world images, covering diverse conditions such as strong illumination, surgical lighting, and underwater low-light environments, demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves accuracy and robustness comparable to state-of-the-art analytic and iterative PnP methods, while maintaining high computational efficiency.

Specifically, we first construct PlanFactory, a modular design space that standardizes diverse planning paradigms within a unified codebase encompassing topology, initialization, adaptation, and navigation, thereby providing a common interface for heterogeneous planning patterns. Leveraging PlanFactory, we collect high-quality planning trajectories and train Todo-14B via \\textit{Impedance-Guided Preference Optimization} (IGPO), a multi-objective reinforcement learning objective that encourages the generation of planning systems that are performant, stable, and token-efficient across arbitrary tasks and agent backbones.

Project page: https://lhyfst.github.io/balancehead/", "summary": "Conditioning is crucial for stable training of full-head 3D GANs. Without any conditioning signal, the model suffers from severe mode collapse, making it impractical to training. However, a series of previous full-head 3D GANs conventionally choose the view angle as the conditioning input, which leads to a bias in the learned 3D full-head space along the conditional view direction. This is evident in the significant differences in generation quality and diversity between the conditional view and non-conditional views of the generated 3D heads, resulting in global incoherence across different head regions. In this work, we propose to use view-invariant semantic feature as the conditioning input, thereby decoupling the generative capability of 3D heads from the viewing direction. To construct a view-invariant semantic condition for each training image, we create a novel synthesized head image dataset. We leverage FLUX.1 Kontext to extend existing high-quality frontal face datasets to a wide range of view angles. The image clip feature extracted from the frontal view is then used as a shared semantic condition across all views in the extended images, ensuring semantic alignment while eliminating directional bias. This also allows supervision from different views of the same subject to be consolidated under a shared semantic condition, which accelerates training and enhances the global coherence of the generated 3D heads. Moreover, as GANs often experience slower improvements in diversity once the generator learns a few modes that successfully fool the discriminator, our semantic conditioning encourages the generator to follow the true semantic distribution, thereby promoting continuous learning and diverse generation. Extensive experiments on full-head synthesis and single-view GAN inversion demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher fidelity, diversity, and generalizability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u57283D\u5934\u90e8\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GAN\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89d2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u584c\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf/\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u5168\u5934\u90e83D GAN\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u89c6\u89d2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u89d2\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5934\u90e8\u5404\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6d88\u9664\u8be5\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5404\u89d2\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u6e90\u81ea\u6b63\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u7684clip\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u5934\u90e8\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u91c7\u7528FLUX.1 Kontext\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6b63\u9762\u4eba\u8138\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b63\u9762clip\u7279\u5f81\u7edf\u4e00\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u89c6\u89d2\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u5934\u90e83D GAN\u5408\u6210\u53ca\u5355\u89c6\u89d2GAN\u53cd\u6f14\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u5173\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u5934\u90e8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

The fidelity of these maps is paramount, as an accurate environmental representation is a prerequisite for stable and precise localization. Factor graphs provide a powerful approach for sensor fusion, enabling the estimation of the maximum a posteriori solution. However, the discrete nature of graph-based representations, combined with asynchronous sensor measurements, complicates consistent state estimation. The design of an optimal factor graph topology remains an open challenge, especially in multi-sensor systems with asynchronous data. Conventional approaches rely on a rigid graph structure, which becomes inefficient with sensors of disparate rates. Although preintegration techniques can mitigate this for high-rate sensors, their applicability is limited. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel approach that incrementally constructs connected factor graphs, ensuring the incorporation of all available sensor data by choosing the optimal graph topology based on the external evaluation criteria. The proposed methodology facilitates graph compression, reducing the number of nodes (optimized variables) by ~30% on average while maintaining map quality at a level comparable to conventional approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5730\u56fe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u6b65\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u521a\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u7387\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5730\u56fe\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6839\u636e\u5916\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u589e\u91cf\u5f0f\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u4f18\u8fde\u901a\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u538b\u7f29\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8282\u70b9\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u5747\u7ea630%\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u6240\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5730\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f02\u6b65\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u56e0\u5b50\u56fe\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

In this paper, we show that these methods break down in the presence of multiple valid answers, where disagreement among equally correct responses leads to systematic underestimation of confidence. To enable a systematic study of this phenomenon, we introduce MACE, a benchmark of 12,000 factual questions spanning six domains with varying numbers of correct answers. Experiments across 15 representative calibration methods and four LLM families (7B-72B) reveal that while accuracy increases with answer cardinality, estimated confidence consistently decreases, causing severe miscalibration for questions with mixed answer counts. To address this issue, we propose Semantic Confidence Aggregation (SCA), which aggregates confidence over multiple high-probability sampled responses.

To fill this gap, we introduce RoadSafe365, a large-scale vision-language benchmark that supports fine-grained analysis of traffic safety from extensive and diverse real-world video data collections. Unlike prior works that focus primarily on coarse accident identification, RoadSafe365 is independently curated and systematically organized using a hierarchical taxonomy that refines and extends foundational definitions of crash, incident, and violation to bridge official traffic safety standards with data-driven traffic understanding systems. RoadSafe365 provides rich attribute annotations across diverse traffic event types, environmental contexts, and interaction scenarios, yielding 36,196 annotated clips from both dashcam and surveillance cameras.

This paper gives a formal problem definition, proves NP-hardness by reduction from the Weighted Set Packing problem, and derives a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation whose coefficients directly encode unique coverage rewards and pairwise overlap penalties. A single penalty parameter controls the coverage-overlap trade-off. We distinguish between a soft regime, which supports multi-objective exploration, and a hard regime, in which the penalty is strong enough to effectively enforce near-disjoint routes. We describe a practical pipeline for generating city instances, constructing candidate routes, building the QUBO matrix, and solving it with an exact mixed-integer solver (Gurobi), simulated annealing, and D-Wave hybrid quantum annealing. Experiments on Barcelona instances with up to 10 000 vehicles reveal a clear coverage-overlap knee and show that Pareto-optimal solutions are mainly obtained under the hard-penalty regime, while D-Wave hybrid solvers and Gurobi achieve essentially identical objective values with only minor differences in runtime as problem size grows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u91cd\u590d\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u9053\u8def\u8986\u76d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5173\u7cfb\u5230\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u6548\u679c\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002\u9700\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7f51\u7edc\u8986\u76d6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u52a0\u6743\u96c6\u5408\u6253\u5305\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5f52\u7ea6\u8bc1\u660e\u5176NP\u96be\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e8c\u6b21\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u4e8c\u5143\u4f18\u5316\uff08QUBO\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u552f\u4e00\u8986\u76d6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u91cd\u53e0\u60e9\u7f5a\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u7f6e\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u8282\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u91cd\u53e0\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4ece\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u5230QUBO\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8054\u5408\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6c42\u89e3\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5df4\u585e\u7f57\u90a3\u57ce\u5e02\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3001\u6700\u591a1\u4e07\u53f0\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0e\u91cd\u53e0\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u62d0\u70b9\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u591a\u5728\u9ad8\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u3002D-Wave\u6df7\u5408\u91cf\u5b50\u9000\u706b\u548cGurobi\u4e24\u79cd\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u95ee\u9898\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u4ec5\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7565\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "QUBO\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u9ad8\u60e9\u7f5a\u53c2\u6570\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u8986\u76d6\u6700\u5927\u4e14\u91cd\u53e0\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5747\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u7ea7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Based on these insights, we propose SparseEval, a method that, for the first time, adopts gradient descent to optimize anchor weights and employs an iterative refinement strategy for anchor selection. We utilize the representation capacity of MLP to handle sparse optimization and propose the Anchor Importance Score and Candidate Importance Score to evaluate the value of each item for task-aware refinement.

However, these SR models introduce a previously unexplored attack surface into imaging pipelines. In this paper, we present AdvSR, a framework demonstrating that adversarial behavior can be embedded directly into SR model weights during training, requiring no access to inputs at inference time. Unlike prior attacks that perturb inputs or rely on backdoor triggers, AdvSR operates entirely at the model level. By jointly optimizing for reconstruction quality and targeted adversarial outcomes, AdvSR produces models that appear benign under standard image quality metrics while inducing downstream misclassification. We evaluate AdvSR on three SR architectures (SRCNN, EDSR, SwinIR) paired with a YOLOv11 classifier and demonstrate that AdvSR models can achieve high attack success rates with minimal quality degradation. These findings highlight a new model-level threat for imaging pipelines, with implications for how practitioners source and validate models in safety-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08SR\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5c06\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u690d\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e14\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u8bb8\u591a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u4eba\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd9\u4e9bSR\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u8f7d\u4f53\u3002\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63ed\u793aSR\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u5c42\u9762\u53ef\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u63d0\u9192\u4e1a\u754c\u6ce8\u610f\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u8d2d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdvSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u653b\u51fb\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u8fdbSR\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u540e\u95e8\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cAdvSR\u5b8c\u5168\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728SRCNN\u3001EDSR\u3001SwinIR\u4e09\u79cdSR\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u914d\u5408YOLOv11\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cAdvSR\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6b63\u5e38\uff09\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53ef\u88ab\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u3001\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u8d2d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

We evaluate command center selection across three technology maturity scenarios. Results show transitioning from conservative (1:3 human-robot supervision) to future autonomous operations (1:10) yields significant cost reduction while maintaining complete critical infrastructure coverage.

In this work, we address this gap from a mechanistic point of view by investigating how instruction-specific representations are constructed and utilized in different stages of post-training: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Via causal mediation, we identify that instruction representation is fairly localized in models. These representations, which we call Instruction Vectors (IVs), demonstrate a curious juxtaposition of linear separability along with non-linear causal interaction, broadly questioning the scope of the linear representation hypothesis commonplace in mechanistic interpretability. To disentangle the non-linear causal interaction, we propose a novel method to localize information processing in language models that is free from the implicit linear assumptions of patching-based techniques. We find that, conditioned on the task representations formed in the early layers, different information pathways are selected in the later layers to solve that task, i.e., IVs act as circuit selectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u6307\u4ee4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aInstruction Vectors (IVs)\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u51fa\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u754c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5185\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u6307\u4ee4\u4fe1\u606f\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u673a\u5236\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)\u548cDirect Preference Optimization (DPO)\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2d\u6307\u4ee4\u76f8\u5173\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u53ca\u4f5c\u7528\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u7ebf\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u8868\u5f81\uff08IVs\uff09\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u76f8\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\uff0c\u65e2\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u671f\u5c42\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u671f\u5c42\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u901a\u8def\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u5373IVs\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u201c\u7535\u8def\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u201d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d28\u7591\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u5b66\u4e2d\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6307\u4ee4\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

By embedding images into a transport domain via invertible transformations, TBM facilitates effective classification, regression, and other tasks using transport-domain features. Crucially, the inverse mapping enables the projection of analytic results back into the original image space, allowing researchers to directly interpret clinical features associated with model outputs in a spatially meaningful way. To facilitate broader adoption of TBM in clinical imaging research, we present 3D-TBM, a tool designed for morphological analysis of 3D medical images. The framework includes data preprocessing, computation of optimal transport embeddings, and analytical methods such as visualization of main transport directions, together with techniques for discerning discriminating directions and related analysis methods. We also provide comprehensive documentation and practical tutorials to support researchers interested in applying 3D-TBM in their own medical imaging studies.

Although recent works in reinforcement learning have yielded various locomotion strategies, planning over multiple experts remains a complex issue. Existing approaches encounter several constraints: traditional planners are unable to integrate skill-specific policies, whereas hierarchical learning frameworks often lose interpretability and require retraining whenever new policies are added. In this paper, we propose a feasibility-guided planning framework that successfully incorporates multiple terrain-specific policies. Each policy is paired with a Feasibility-Net, which learned to predict feasibility tensors based on the local elevation maps and task vectors. This integration allows classical planning algorithms to derive optimal paths. Through both simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our method efficiently generates reliable plans across diverse and challenging terrains, while consistently aligning with the capabilities of the underlying policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u5730\u5f62\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u4ea7\u751f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u5f62\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65e0\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u5c42\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5730\u5f62\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u914d\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2aFeasibility-Net\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u7a0b\u56fe\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u5730\u5f62\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u517c\u5bb9\u5e95\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u591a\u6280\u80fd\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Fine-tuned on a community-annotated dataset of 6,885 Polish texts, these models classify content across five safety categories: Hate/Aggression, Vulgarities, Sexual Content, Crime, and Self-Harm. Our evaluation demonstrates that both models achieve strong performance on multiple benchmarks. The 0.5B variant offers the best overall discrimination capability with F1 scores of 0.791 (micro) and 0.785 (macro) on the test set, while the 0.1B variant demonstrates exceptional efficiency. Notably, Bielik Guard 0.1B v1.1 achieves superior precision (77.65\\%) and very low false positive rate (0.63\\%) on real user prompts, outperforming HerBERT-PL-Guard (31.55\\% precision, 4.70\\% FPR) despite identical model size.

We introduce TwistNet-2D, a lightweight module that computes \\emph{local} pairwise channel products under directional spatial displacement, jointly encoding where features co-occur and how they interact. The core component, Spiral-Twisted Channel Interaction (STCI), shifts one feature map along a prescribed direction before element-wise channel multiplication, thereby capturing the cross-position co-occurrence patterns characteristic of structured and periodic textures. Aggregating four directional heads with learned channel reweighting and injecting the result through a sigmoid-gated residual path, \\TwistNet incurs only 3.5% additional parameters and 2% additional FLOPs over ResNet-18, yet consistently surpasses both parameter-matched and substantially larger baselines -- including ConvNeXt, Swin Transformer, and hybrid CNN--Transformer architectures -- across four texture and fine-grained recognition benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTwistNet-2D\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u901a\u9053\u5bf9\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u901a\u9053\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7eb9\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e8c\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982Gram\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027\u6c60\u5316\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u5168\u5c40\u901a\u9053\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5374\u635f\u5931\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u867d\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u6355\u6349\u53cc\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1TwistNet-2D\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u87ba\u65cb\u626d\u8f6c\u901a\u9053\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08STCI\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u6309\u65b9\u5411\u504f\u79fb\u8fdb\u884c\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u901a\u9053\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u5b9a\u5411\u7684\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u878d\u5408\u56db\u4e2a\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7ecf\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u548csigmoid\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u8def\u5f84\u5d4c\u5165\u4e3b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7b97\u529b\u6d88\u8017\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "result": "TwistNet-2D\u4ec5\u6bd4ResNet-18\u65b0\u589e3.5%\u53c2\u6570\u548c2%\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u7eb9\u7406\u53ca\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u751a\u81f3\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ConvNeXt\u3001Swin Transformer\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "TwistNet-2D\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u4e8c\u9636\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee3\u4ef7\u4f4e\u5ec9\u5374\u6027\u80fd\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u662f\u7eb9\u7406/\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u4ef7\u6bd4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

In particular, assessing control algorithms requires an accurate vehicle dynamics simulation. However, recent publications use models with varying levels of detail. This disparity makes it difficult to compare individual control algorithms. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the influence of the fidelity of vehicle dynamics modeling on the closed-loop behavior of trajectory-following controllers. For this purpose, we introduce a comprehensive Autoware-compatible vehicle model. By simplifying this, we derive models with varying fidelity. Evaluating over 550 simulation runs allows us to quantify each model's approximation quality compared to real-world data. Furthermore, we investigate whether the influence of model simplifications changes with varying margins to the acceleration limit of the vehicle. From this, we deduce to which degree a vehicle model can be simplified to evaluate control algorithms depending on the specific application. The real-world data used to validate the simulation environment originate from the Indy Autonomous Challenge race at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in June 2023. They show the fastest fully autonomous lap of TUM Autonomous Motorsport, with vehicle speeds reaching 267 kph and lateral accelerations of up to 15 mps2.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u95ed\u73af\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u96be\u4ee5\u6a2a\u5411\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u660e\u786e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u517c\u5bb9Autoware\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u8fc7550\u7ec4\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8d5b\u8f66\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u52a0\u901f\u88d5\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5404\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53ca\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u4eff\u771f\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

A Comparative Study on the Cross-Lingual Transfer of Composite Harms", "comment": "Accepted at the AICS Workshop, AAAI 2026", "summary": "Most safety evaluations of large language models (LLMs) remain anchored in English. Translation is often used as a shortcut to probe multilingual behavior, but it rarely captures the full picture, especially when harmful intent or structure morphs across languages. Some types of harm survive translation almost intact, while others distort or disappear. To study this effect, we introduce CompositeHarm, a translation-based benchmark designed to examine how safety alignment holds up as both syntax and semantics shift. It combines two complementary English datasets, AttaQ, which targets structured adversarial attacks, and MMSafetyBench, which covers contextual, real-world harms, and extends them into six languages: English, Hindi, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, and Gujarati. Using three large models, we find that attack success rates rise sharply in Indic languages, especially under adversarial syntax, while contextual harms transfer more moderately. To ensure scalability and energy efficiency, our study adopts lightweight inference strategies inspired by edge-AI design principles, reducing redundant evaluation passes while preserving cross-lingual fidelity. This design makes large-scale multilingual safety testing both computationally feasible and environmentally conscious. Overall, our results show that translated benchmarks are a necessary first step, but not a sufficient one, toward building grounded, resource-aware, language-adaptive safety systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aCompositeHarm\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u82f1\u6587\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u6216\u8bb8\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u53cd\u6620\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06AttaQ\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u653b\u51fb\uff09\u548cMMSafetyBench\uff08\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f24\u5bb3\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u516d\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5370\u5730\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u906d\u53d7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u60c5\u5883\u578b\u4f24\u5bb3\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8f83\u6e29\u548c\u3002\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u9760\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u4fdd\u969c\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u540e\u7eed\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u52a0\u624e\u5b9e\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u56e0\u5730\u5236\u5b9c\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5b89\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Generative models for materials could help, but are currently limited by the lack of high-quality training data. While recent video generative models effortlessly produce realistic material appearances, this knowledge remains entangled with geometry and lighting. We present VideoNeuMat, a two-stage pipeline that extracts reusable neural material assets from video diffusion models. First, we finetune a large video model (Wan 2.1 14B) to generate material sample videos under controlled camera and lighting trajectories, effectively creating a \"virtual gonioreflectometer\" that preserves the model's material realism while learning a structured measurement pattern. Second, we reconstruct compact neural materials from these videos through a Large Reconstruction Model (LRM) finetuned from a smaller Wan 1.3B video backbone. From 17 generated video frames, our LRM performs single-pass inference to predict neural material parameters that generalize to novel viewing and lighting conditions.

Such interlacing cables create hitches by winding two or more cables around each other, which can enclose payloads or can further develop into knots. Dynamic modeling and control of such hitches is key to mastering the inter-cable manipulation in context of cable-suspended aerial manipulation. This paper introduces an ellipsoid-based kinematic model to connect the geometric nature of a hitch created by two cables and the dynamics of the hitch driven by four aerial vehicles, which reveals the control-affine form of the system. As the constraint for maintaining tension of a cable is also control-affine, we design a quadratic programming-based controller that combines Control Lyapunov and High-Order Control Barrier Functions (CLF-HOCBF-QP) to precisely track a desired hitch position and system shape while enforcing safety constraints like cable tautness. We convert desired geometric reference configurations into target robot positions and introduce a composite error into the Lyapunov function to ensure a relative degree of one to the input.

However, the development of robust diagnostic models remains impeded by acute clinical data scarcity and a lack of interpretable reasoning. Current solutions frequently struggle with cross-lingual generalization and fail to provide the transparent rationales essential for clinical trust. To address these barriers, we introduce SynCog, a novel framework integrating controllable zero-shot multimodal data synthesis with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) deduction fine-tuning. Specifically, SynCog simulates diverse virtual subjects with varying cognitive profiles to effectively alleviate clinical data scarcity. This generative paradigm enables the rapid, zero-shot expansion of clinical corpora across diverse languages, effectively bypassing data bottlenecks in low-resource settings and bolstering the diagnostic performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging this synthesized dataset, we fine-tune a foundational multimodal backbone using a CoT deduction strategy, empowering the model to explicitly articulate diagnostic thought processes rather than relying on black-box predictions. Extensive experiments on the ADReSS and ADReSSo benchmarks demonstrate that augmenting limited clinical data with synthetic phenotypes yields competitive diagnostic performance, achieving Macro-F1 scores of 80.67% and 78.46%, respectively, outperforming current baseline models. Furthermore, evaluation on an independent real-world Mandarin cohort (CIR-E) demonstrates robust cross-linguistic generalization, attaining a Macro-F1 of 48.71%.

We introduce Cross-View World Models (XVWM), trained with a cross-view prediction objective: given a sequence of frames from one viewpoint, predict the future state from the same or a different viewpoint after an action is taken. Enforcing cross-view consistency acts as geometric regularization: because the input and output views may share little or no visual overlap, to predict across viewpoints, the model must learn view-invariant representations of the environment's 3D structure. We train on synchronized multi-view gameplay data from Aimlabs, an aim-training platform providing precisely aligned multi-camera recordings with high-frequency action labels. The resulting model gives agents parallel imagination streams across viewpoints, enabling planning in whichever frame of reference best suits the task while executing from the egocentric view. Our results show that multi-view consistency provides a strong learning signal for spatially grounded representations.

These templates can force policies to process irrelevant information that distracts from critical action-prediction signals. This creates a bottleneck: without successful policies, we cannot verify reasoning quality; without quality reasoning, we cannot build robust policies. We introduce R&B-EnCoRe, which enables models to bootstrap embodied reasoning from internet-scale knowledge through self-supervised refinement. By treating reasoning as a latent variable within importance-weighted variational inference, models can generate and distill a refined reasoning training dataset of embodiment-specific strategies without external rewards, verifiers, or human annotation. We validate R&B-EnCoRe across manipulation (Franka Panda in simulation, WidowX in hardware), legged navigation (bipedal, wheeled, bicycle, quadruped), and autonomous driving embodiments using various VLA architectures with 1B, 4B, 7B, and 30B parameters. Our approach achieves 28% gains in manipulation success, 101% improvement in navigation scores, and 21% reduction in collision-rate metric over models that indiscriminately reason about all available primitives.

A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on content quality, remain invariant to irrelevant context, and transparently reflect the factors driving its decisions. We test this ideal via controlled cue perturbations-synthetic metadata labels injected into evaluation prompts-for six judge models: GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash, Gemma-3-27B, Qwen3-235B, Claude-3-Haiku, and Llama3-70B. Experiments span two complementary datasets with distinct evaluation regimes: ELI5 (factual QA) and LitBench (open-ended creative writing). We study six cue families: source, temporal, age, gender, ethnicity, and educational status. Beyond measuring verdict shift rates (VSR), we introduce cue acknowledgment rate (CAR) to quantify whether judges explicitly reference the injected cues in their natural-language rationales. Across cues with strong behavioral effects-e.g., provenance hierarchies (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown), recency preferences (New > Old), and educational-status favoritism-CAR is typically at or near zero, indicating that shortcut reliance is largely unreported even when it drives decisions. Crucially, CAR is also dataset-dependent: explicit cue recognition is more likely to surface in the factual ELI5 setting for some models and cues, but often collapses in the open-ended LitBench regime, where large verdict shifts can persist despite zero acknowledgment. The combination of substantial verdict sensitivity and limited cue acknowledgment reveals an explanation gap in LLM-as-judge pipelines, raising concerns about reliability of model-based evaluation in both research and deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5224\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u6b63\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u5224\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4e14\u5f88\u5c11\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u63d0\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5458\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u8bc4\u5224\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u516c\u6b63\u6027\u548c\u900f\u660e\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5185\u5bb9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4f1a\u53d7\u65e0\u5173\u63d0\u793a\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bc4\u5ba1\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u5408\u6210\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6807\u7b7e\uff08\u5982\u6765\u6e90\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u65cf\u7fa4\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9GPT-4o\u3001Gemini-2.0-Flash\u3001Gemma-3-27B\u3001Qwen3-235B\u3001Claude-3-Haiku\u3001Llama3-70B\u516d\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ELI5\uff08\u4e8b\u5b9e\u578b\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\u548cLitBench\uff08\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5224\u51b3\u53d8\u52a8\u7387\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u627f\u8ba4\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5224\u51b3\u6781\u6613\u53d7\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5982\u4e13\u5bb6\u3001\u6700\u8fd1\u6027\u53ca\u6559\u80b2\u6c34\u5e73\u4fe1\u606f\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc4\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u660e\u786e\u627f\u8ba4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u627f\u8ba4\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e\u96f6\u3002\u4e14\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u627f\u8ba4\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u57fa\u672c\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8bc4\u5206\u968f\u63d0\u793a\u5f3a\u70c8\u6ce2\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62c5\u4efb\u5224\u5b98\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7f3a\u53e3\u548c\u6613\u53d7\u65e0\u5173\u56e0\u7d20\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8d28\u7591\u3002"}}

It might cause vision loss and blindness. To prevent irreversible vision loss, early detection through systematic screening is crucial. Although researchers have developed numerous automated deep learning-based algorithms for DR screening, their clinical applicability remains limited, particularly in lesion segmentation. Our method provides pixel-level annotations for lesions, which practically supports Ophthalmologist to screen DR from fundus images. In this work, we segmented four types of DR-related lesions: microaneurysms, soft exudates, hard exudates, and hemorrhages on 757 images from DDR dataset. To enhance lesion segmentation, an attention mechanism was integrated with DeepLab-V3+. Compared to the baseline model, the Attention-DeepLab model increases mean average precision (mAP) from 0.3010 to 0.3326 and the mean Intersection over Union (IoU) from 0.1791 to 0.1928.

Automat. Lett. (RA-L) 2026", "summary": "Online change detection is crucial for mobile robots to efficiently navigate through dynamic environments. Detecting changes in transient settings, such as active construction sites or frequently reconfigured indoor spaces, is particularly challenging due to frequent occlusions and spatiotemporal variations. Existing approaches often struggle to detect changes and fail to update the map across different observations. To address these limitations, we propose a dual-head network designed for online change detection and long-term map maintenance. A key difficulty in this task is the collection and alignment of real-world data, as manually registering structural differences over time is both labor-intensive and often impractical. To overcome this, we develop a data augmentation strategy that synthesizes structural changes by importing elements from different scenes, enabling effective model training without the need for extensive ground-truth annotations. Experiments conducted at real-world construction sites and in indoor office environments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse scenarios, achieving efficient and accurate map updates.\\resubmit{Our source code and additional material are available at: https://chamelion-pages.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u957f\u671f\u5730\u56fe\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u53cc\u5934\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5728\u7ebf\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9891\u7e41\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u906e\u6321\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u65bd\u5de5\u73b0\u573a\u6216\u9891\u7e41\u53d8\u52a8\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u68c0\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u53ca\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u5730\u56fe\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u624b\u52a8\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u914d\u51c6\u5730\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e5f\u6781\u4e3a\u7e41\u7410\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5934\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96be\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5ba4\u5185\u529e\u516c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5730\u56fe\u66f4\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u5730\u56fe\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Existing compression and eviction methods often struggle to balance accuracy, compression ratio, and hardware efficiency. We propose DeltaKV, a residual-based KV cache compression framework motivated by two empirical findings: long-range inter-token similarity and highly shared latent components in KV representations. Instead of discarding tokens, DeltaKV encodes semantic residuals relative to retrieved historical references, preserving fidelity while substantially reducing storage. To translate compression gains into real system speedups, we further introduce Sparse-vLLM, a high-performance inference engine with decoupled memory management and kernels optimized for sparse and irregular KV layouts. Experiments show that DeltaKV reduces KV cache memory to 29\\% of the original while maintaining near-lossless accuracy on LongBench, SCBench, and AIME. When integrated with Sparse-vLLM, it achieves up to 2$\\times$ throughput improvement over vLLM in long-context scenarios, demonstrating a practical path toward scalable long-context LLM deployment.

We present a filtering and segmentation algorithm for detecting precipitates in FIB cross-section micrographs, optimized using linear genetic programming (LGP), which accounts for the various artifacts. To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline. Under ideal conditions--a population size of 60 and a maximum program length of 5 blocks--our system was able to find a near-human accuracy solution with an average evaluation error of 1.8% when comparing segmentations pixel-by-pixel to a human baseline using an XOR error evaluation. Our automation work enabled faster iteration cycles and furthered exploration of the material composition and processing space: our optimized pipeline algorithm processes a 3.6 megapixel image in about 2 seconds on average. This ultimately enables convergence on strong, low-activation, precipitation hardened copper alloys for additive manufactured fusion reactor parts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u9057\u4f20\u7f16\u7a0b\uff08LGP\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5fae\u89c2\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6790\u51fa\u76f8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5408\u91d1\u5f00\u53d1\u8fed\u4ee3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u94cc\u57fa\u94dc\u5408\u91d1\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56fe\u50cf\u56e0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6750\u6599\u7814\u53d1\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u4f20\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7531\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LGP\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u79cd\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a2160\uff0c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6700\u5927\u957f\u5ea65\uff09\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u4ec5\u4e3a1.8%\uff0c3.6\u5146\u50cf\u7d20\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea62\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u589e\u6750\u5236\u9020\u94dc\u5408\u91d1\u6750\u6599\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u52a0\u5feb\u5f3a\u97e7\u3001\u4f4e\u6d3b\u5316\u6790\u51fa\u5f3a\u5316\u94dc\u5408\u91d1\u5728\u805a\u53d8\u53cd\u5e94\u5806\u96f6\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8fdb\u5ea6\u3002"}}

However, iterative denoising leads to substantial inference latency, limiting control frequency in real-time closed-loop systems. Existing acceleration methods either reduce sampling steps, bypass diffusion through direct prediction, or reuse past actions, but often struggle to jointly preserve action quality and achieve consistently low latency. In this work, we propose STEP, a lightweight spatiotemporal consistency prediction mechanism to construct high-quality warm-start actions that are both distributionally close to the target action and temporally consistent, without compromising the generative capability of the original diffusion policy. Then, we propose a velocity-aware perturbation injection mechanism that adaptively modulates actuation excitation based on temporal action variation to prevent execution stall especially for real-world tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed prediction induces a locally contractive mapping, ensuring convergence of action errors during diffusion refinement. We conduct extensive evaluations on nine simulated benchmarks and two real-world tasks. Notably, STEP with 2 steps can achieve an average 21.6% and 27.5% higher success rate than BRIDGER and DDIM on the RoboMimic benchmark and real-world tasks, respectively. These results demonstrate that STEP consistently advances the Pareto frontier of inference latency and success rate over existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86STEP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u65f6\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u52a8\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u56e0\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u4f46\u5176\u9010\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u65f6\u9ad8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5b9e\u65f6\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u52a8\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u65f6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "STEP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u63a5\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u901f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6270\u52a8\u6ce8\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u52a8\u4f5c\u53d8\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6267\u884c\u505c\u6ede\u3002\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u57289\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\u548c2\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cSTEP\u53ea\u97002\u6b65\u5373\u53ef\u6bd4BRIDGER\u548cDDIM\u5206\u522b\u5728RoboMimic\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534721.6%\u548c27.5%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "STEP\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u52a8\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u65f6\u4e0e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u6cbf\u3002"}}

However, current SAEs are trained per modality, producing dictionaries whose features are not directly understandable and whose explanations do not transfer across domains. In this study, we introduce LUCID (Learning Unified vision-language sparse Codes for Interpretable concept Discovery), a unified vision-language sparse autoencoder that learns a shared latent dictionary for image patch and text token representations, while reserving private capacity for modality-specific details. We achieve feature alignment by coupling the shared codes with a learned optimal transport matching objective without the need of labeling. LUCID yields interpretable shared features that support patch-level grounding, establish cross-modal neuron correspondence, and enhance robustness against the concept clustering problem in similarity-based evaluation. Leveraging the alignment properties, we develop an automated dictionary interpretation pipeline based on term clustering without manual observations.

Most prior AM demonstrations rely on external motion capture (MoCap) and emphasize position control for coarse interactions, limiting deployability. We present a fully onboard perception-control pipeline for contact-rich AM that achieves accurate motion tracking and regulated contact wrenches without MoCap. The main components are (1) an augmented visual-inertial odometry (VIO) estimator with contact-consistency factors that activate only during interaction, tightening uncertainty around the contact frame and reducing drift, and (2) image-based visual servoing (IBVS) to mitigate perception-control coupling, together with a hybrid force-motion controller that regulates contact wrenches and lateral motion for stable contact. Experiments show that our approach closes the perception-to-wrench loop using only onboard sensing, yielding an velocity estimation improvement of 66.01% at contact, reliable target approach, and stable force holding-pointing toward deployable, in-the-wild aerial manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b8c\u6210\u590d\u6742\u63a5\u89e6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7c97\u7565\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u9ad8\u63a5\u89e6\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u60ef\u5bfc\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff08VIO\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\u542f\u7528\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u56e0\u5b50\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4f3a\u670d\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u529b-\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u529b\u548c\u6a2a\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u7528\u673a\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u95ed\u5408\u201c\u611f\u77e5-\u4f5c\u7528\u529b\u201d\u56de\u8def\uff0c\u4f7f\u63a5\u89e6\u65f6\u901f\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e66.01%\uff0c\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u9760\u8fd1\u4e0e\u6301\u529b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7a7a\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u63a5\u89e6\u4efb\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Metric-based methods, which extract statistically distinguishable features of MGTs, are often more practical than complex model-based methods that are prone to overfitting. Given their diverse designs, we first place representative metric-based methods within a unified framework, enabling a clear assessment of their advantages and limitations. Our analysis identifies a core challenge across these methods: the token-level detection score is easily biased by the inherent randomness of the MGTs generation process. To address this, we theoretically and empirically reveal two relationships of context detection scores that may aid calibration: Neighbor Similarity and Initial Instability.

Guided by vision-language model (VLM) priors, the network learns to modulate each modality's contribution based on the illumination state while leveraging object embeddings for segmentation, rather than applying a fixed fusion policy.

In this context, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a distinct advantage, as it can explicitly guide the selection of subsequent viewpoints and then refine the representation with new observations. However, existing approaches rely solely on geometric cues, neglect manipulation-relevant semantics, and tend to prioritize exploitation over exploration. To tackle these limitations, we introduce an instance-aware Next Best View (NBV) policy that prioritizes underexplored regions by leveraging object features. Specifically, our object-aware 3DGS distills instancelevel information into one-hot object vectors, which are used to compute confidence-weighted information gain that guides the identification of regions associated with erroneous and uncertain Gaussians. Furthermore, our method can be easily adapted to an object-centric NBV, which focuses view selection on a target object, thereby improving reconstruction robustness to object placement. Experiments demonstrate that our NBV policy reduces depth error by up to 77.14% on the synthetic dataset and 34.10% on the real-world GraspNet dataset compared to baselines. Moreover, compared to targeting the entire scene, performing NBV on a specific object yields an additional reduction of 25.60% in depth error for that object.

Prior detectors developed for auto-regressive LLMs typically rely on single-pass cues and do not directly transfer to diffusion generation, where factuality evidence is distributed across the denoising trajectory and may appear, drift, or be self-corrected over time. We introduce TDGNet, a temporal dynamic graph framework that formulates hallucination detection as learning over evolving token-level attention graphs. At each denoising step, we sparsify the attention graph and update per-token memories via message passing, then apply temporal attention to aggregate trajectory-wide evidence for final prediction. Experiments on LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across QA benchmarks show consistent AUROC improvements over output-based, latent-based, and static-graph baselines, with single-pass inference and modest overhead.

In this work, we propose a unified optimization framework that reinterprets prior art as implicit strategies to avoid these corrupted regions. Based on this insight, we introduce Adaptive Matching Distillation (AMD), a self-correcting mechanism that utilizes reward proxies to explicitly detect and escape Forbidden Zones. AMD dynamically prioritizes corrective gradients via structural signal decomposition and introduces Repulsive Landscape Sharpening to enforce steep energy barriers against failure mode collapse. Extensive experiments across image and video generation tasks (e.g., SDXL, Wan2.1) and rigorous benchmarks (e.g., VBench, GenEval) demonstrate that AMD significantly enhances sample fidelity and training robustness. For instance, AMD improves the HPSv2 score on SDXL from 30.64 to 31.25, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These findings validate that explicitly rectifying optimization trajectories within Forbidden Zones is essential for pushing the performance ceiling of few-step generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u84b8\u998f\uff08DMD\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136DMD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\uff08Forbidden Zone\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u6559\u5e08\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u6392\u65a5\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u5347DMD\u5728\u8fd9\u7c7b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709DMD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u2018\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5339\u914d\u84b8\u998f\u2019\uff08AMD\uff09\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u4ee3\u7406\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u9003\u79bb\u4e0d\u826f\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u52bf\u573a\u9510\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982SDXL\u3001Wan2.1\uff09\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982VBench\u3001GenEval\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cAMD\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5982SDXL\u4e0a\u7684HPSv2\u5206\u6570\u4ece30.64\u63d0\u5347\u523031.25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u907f\u514d\u8fdb\u5165\u2018Forbidden Zone\u2019\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

A major barrier is embodiment variability: different dexterous hands exhibit distinct kinematics and dynamics, forcing prior methods to train separate policies or rely on shared action spaces with per-embodiment decoder heads. We present DexFormer, an end-to-end, dynamics-aware cross-embodiment policy built on a modified transformer backbone that conditions on historical observations. By using temporal context to infer morphology and dynamics on the fly, DexFormer adapts to diverse hand configurations and produces embodiment-appropriate control actions. Trained over a variety of procedurally generated dexterous-hand assets, DexFormer acquires a generalizable manipulation prior and exhibits strong zero-shot transfer to Leap Hand, Allegro Hand, and Rapid Hand. Our results show that a single policy can generalize across heterogeneous hand embodiments, establishing a scalable foundation for cross-embodiment dexterous manipulation.

Standard reasoning LLMs verbalize intermediate steps as chain-of-thought; latent reasoning transformers (LRTs) instead perform deliberation entirely in continuous hidden space. We investigate an LRT, decoding the model's evolving beliefs at every step on a multiple-choice QA benchmark. We find that the model spontaneously learns a structured search process in latent space. Deliberation follows a consistent trajectory: an exploration phase where probability mass spreads across candidates, tentative commitment to a frontrunner, and either convergence or backtracking.

The enhanced images result in areas with large local noise and loss of more details without proper guidance for global information. Attention mechanisms can better focus on and use global information. However, attention to images could significantly increase the number of parameters and computations. We propose a Row-Column Separated Attention module (RCSA) inserted after an improved U-Net. The RCSA module's input is the mean and maximum of the row and column of the feature map, which utilizes global information to guide local information with fewer parameters. We propose two temporal loss functions to apply the method to low-light video enhancement and maintain temporal consistency.

Solving this vast challenge requires scalable coral regeneration technologies that can breed climate-resilient species and accelerate the natural regrowth processes; actions that are impeded by the absence of safe and robust tools to handle the fragile coral. We investigate ReefFlex, a generative soft finger design methodology that explores a diverse space of soft fingers to produce a set of candidates capable of safely grasping fragile and geometrically heterogeneous coral in a cluttered environment. Our key insight is encoding heterogeneous grasping into a reduced set of motion primitives, creating a simplified, tractable multi-objective optimisation problem. To evaluate the method, we design a soft robot for reef rehabilitation, which grows and manipulates coral in onshore aquaculture facilities for future reef out-planting. We demonstrate ReefFlex increases both grasp success and grasp quality (disturbance resistance, positioning accuracy) and reduces in adverse events encountered during coral manipulation compared to reference designs. ReefFlex, offers a generalisable method to design soft end-effectors for complex handling and paves a pathway towards automation in previously unachievable domains like coral handling for restoration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u8f6f\u4f53\u5939\u6307\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5ReefFlex\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u518d\u751f\u6613\u788e\u7684\u73ca\u745a\uff0c\u4e3a\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u751f\u6001\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u5916\u6765\u7269\u79cd\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5168\u7403\u73ca\u745a\u7901\u6b63\u7ecf\u5386\u524d\u6240\u672a\u6709\u7684\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8106\u5f31\u73ca\u745a\u7684\u518d\u751f\u548c\u642c\u8fd0\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u751f\u6001\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReefFlex\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4f53\u5939\u6307\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u6293\u53d6\u52a8\u4f5c\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8f6c\u5316\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u73ca\u745a\u642c\u8fd0\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3002", "result": "ReefFlex\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u5939\u6307\uff0c\u5728\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u6293\u53d6\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u53c2\u7167\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "ReefFlex\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7269\u4f53\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u524d\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u73ca\u745a\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This paper serves as one of the first attempts to examine these biases within LLM-generated recommendations. We leverage prompt engineering to elicit product suggestions from LLMs for various race and gender groups and employ three analytical methods-Marked Words, Support Vector Machines, and Jensen-Shannon Divergence-to identify and quantify biases. Our findings reveal significant disparities in the recommendations for demographic groups, underscoring the need for more equitable LLM recommendation systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6d88\u8d39\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u7684\u663e\u8457\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u4ea7\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5411LLM\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u79cd\u65cf\u548c\u6027\u522b\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4ea7\u54c1\u63a8\u8350\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\u8bcd\uff08Marked Words\uff09\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08SVM\uff09\u3001Jensen-Shannon\u6563\u5ea6\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u5728LLM\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u63a8\u8350\u5185\u5bb9\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6027\u522b\u4e0e\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728LLM\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u3002"}}

Prior works on dialogue summary evaluation largely ignore the complexities specific to this task: (i) shift in structure, from multiple speakers discussing information in a scattered fashion across several turns, to a summary's sentences, and (ii) shift in narration viewpoint, from speakers' first/second-person narration, standardized third-person narration in the summary. In this work, we introduce our framework DIALSUMMER to address the above. We propose DIAL-SUMMER's taxonomy of errors to comprehensively evaluate dialogue summaries at two hierarchical levels: DIALOGUE-LEVEL that focuses on the broader speakers/turns, and WITHIN-TURN-LEVEL that focuses on the information talked about inside a turn. We then present DIAL-SUMMER's dataset composed of dialogue summaries manually annotated with our taxonomy's fine-grained errors. We conduct empirical analyses of these annotated errors, and observe interesting trends (e.g., turns occurring in middle of the dialogue are the most frequently missed in the summary, extrinsic hallucinations largely occur at the end of the summary).

However, progress has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets providing both ECG images and their corresponding ground truth signals with comprehensive annotations. We introduce PTB-XL-Image-17K, a complete synthetic ECG image dataset comprising 17,271 high-quality 12-lead ECG images generated from the PTB-XL signal database. Our dataset uniquely provides five complementary data types per sample: (1) realistic ECG images with authentic grid patterns and annotations (50% with visible grid, 50% without), (2) pixel-level segmentation masks, (3) ground truth time-series signals, (4) bounding box annotations in YOLO format for both lead regions and lead name labels, and (5) comprehensive metadata including visual parameters and patient information. We present an open-source Python framework enabling customizable dataset generation with controllable parameters including paper speed (25/50 mm/s), voltage scale (5/10 mm/mV), sampling rate (500 Hz), grid appearance (4 colors), and waveform characteristics. The dataset achieves 100% generation success rate with an average processing time of 1.35 seconds per sample. PTB-XL-Image-17K addresses critical gaps in ECG digitization research by providing the first large-scale resource supporting the complete pipeline: lead detection, waveform segmentation, and signal extraction with full ground truth for rigorous evaluation.

Jin Kim"], "title": "Personalized Autonomous Driving via Optimal Control with Clearance Constraints from Questionnaires", "comment": null, "summary": "Driving without considering the preferred separation distance from surrounding vehicles may cause discomfort for users. To address this limitation, we propose a planning framework that explicitly incorporates user preferences regarding the desired level of safe clearance from surrounding vehicles. We design a questionnaire purposefully tailored to capture user preferences relevant to our framework, while minimizing unnecessary questions. Specifically, the questionnaire considers various interaction-relevant factors, including the surrounding vehicle's size, speed, position, and maneuvers of surrounding vehicles, as well as the maneuvers of the ego vehicle. The response indicates the user-preferred clearance for the scenario defined by the question and is incorporated as constraints in the optimal control problem. However, it is impractical to account for all possible scenarios that may arise in a driving environment within a single optimal control problem, as the resulting computational complexity renders real-time implementation infeasible. To overcome this limitation, we approximate the original problem by decomposing it into multiple subproblems, each dealing with one fixed scenario.

While generally structured, these documents are often dense, bureaucratic, and highly heterogeneous across municipalities, exhibiting significant variation in language, terminology, structure, and overall organization. This heterogeneity makes them difficult for non-experts to interpret and challenging for intelligent automated systems to process, limiting public transparency and civic engagement. To address these challenges, computational methods can be employed to structure and interpret such complex documents. In particular, Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers well-established methods that can enhance the accessibility and interpretability of governmental records. In this focus article, we review foundational NLP tasks that support the structuring of local governance meeting documents. Specifically, we review three core tasks: document segmentation, domain-specific entity extraction and automatic text summarization, which are essential for navigating lengthy deliberations, identifying political actors and personal information, and generating concise representations of complex decision-making processes. In reviewing these tasks, we discuss methodological approaches, evaluation metrics, and publicly available resources, while highlighting domain-specific challenges such as data scarcity, privacy constraints, and source variability. By synthesizing existing work across these foundational tasks, this article provides a structured overview of how NLP can enhance the structuring and accessibility of local governance meeting records.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff08NLP\uff09\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u5730\u65b9\u653f\u5e9c\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5206\u6bb5\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u62bd\u53d6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6458\u8981\u4e09\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5730\u65b9\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u901a\u5e38\u5197\u957f\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u4e14\u5404\u5730\u65b9\u6807\u51c6\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u666e\u901a\u516c\u4f17\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e5f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u653f\u5e9c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u516c\u6c11\u53c2\u4e0e\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4e09\u9879\u6838\u5fc3NLP\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a1\uff09\u6587\u6863\u5206\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8bae\u7a0b\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b2\uff09\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u4f53\u62bd\u53d6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4f1a\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u3001\u673a\u6784\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4f1a\u8bae\u8fc7\u7a0b\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a\u7b80\u660e\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7b49\u96be\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "NLP\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5730\u65b9\u6cbb\u7406\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u653f\u5e9c\u4fe1\u606f\u900f\u660e\u548c\u516c\u6c11\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u89e3\u51b3\u7279\u6709\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Existing large-scale models often suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight alternatives typically compromise on holistic facial representations and temporal stability. In this paper, we propose SoulX-FlashHead, a unified 1.3B-parameter framework designed for real-time, infinite-length, and high-fidelity streaming video generation. To address the instability of audio features in streaming scenarios, we introduce Streaming-Aware Spatiotemporal Pre-training equipped with a Temporal Audio Context Cache mechanism, which ensures robust feature extraction from short audio fragments. Furthermore, to mitigate the error accumulation and identity drift inherent in long-sequence autoregressive generation, we propose Oracle-Guided Bidirectional Distillation, leveraging ground-truth motion priors to provide precise physical guidance. We also present VividHead, a large-scale, high-quality dataset containing 782 hours of strictly aligned footage to support robust training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulX-FlashHead achieves state-of-the-art performance on HDTF and VFHQ benchmarks.

Additionally, we developed a hierarchical controller in which a human operator provides high-level commands to direct the robot's motion. In a 30-second flight experiment conducted outside a motion capture system, the robot avoided obstacles and ultimately landed on a sunflower. This level of sensing and computational autonomy represents a significant advancement for the aerial microrobotics community, further opening opportunities to explore onboard planning and power autonomy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec51.29\u514b\u7684\u5fae\u578b\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51ed\u501f\u673a\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u60ac\u505c\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u5916\u754c\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\u907f\u969c\u964d\u843d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6606\u866b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ef4\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u98de\u884c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u81ea\u4e3b\u4f5c\u4e1a\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7814\u5236\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u96c6\u6210\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5fae\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u60ac\u505c\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u4e0b\u8fbe\u9ad8\u5c42\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5ba4\u591630\u79d2\u98de\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u907f\u969c\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u529f\u964d\u843d\u5728\u5411\u65e5\u8475\u4e0a\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5398\u7c73\u7ea7\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6210\u679c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u578b\u98de\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u673a\u8f7d\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u81ea\u4e3b\u6253\u4e0b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

We test whether LLMs form the same kinds of conventions in a multimodal communication game. Both humans and LLMs display evidence of convention-formation (increasing the accuracy and consistency of their turns while decreasing their length) when communicating in same-type dyads (humans with humans, AI with AI). However, heterogenous human-AI pairs fail -- suggesting differences in communicative tendencies. In Experiment 2, we ask whether LLMs can be induced to behave more like human conversants, by prompting them to produce superficially humanlike behavior. While the length of their messages matches that of human pairs, accuracy and lexical overlap in human-LLM pairs continues to lag behind that of both human-human and AI-AI pairs.

Existing evaluators frequently struggle with a critical perception gap we term \"Attention Collapse,\" where models neglect cross-image comparisons and fail to capture fine-grained details, resulting in inaccurate perception and miscalibrated scores. To address these limitations, we propose SpatialReward, a reward model that enforces precise verification via explicit spatial reasoning. By anchoring reasoning to predicted edit regions, SpatialReward grounds semantic judgments in pixel-level evidence, significantly enhancing evaluative accuracy. Trained on a curated 260k spatial-aware dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMRB2 and EditReward-Bench, and outperforms proprietary evaluators on our proposed MultiEditReward-Bench. Furthermore, SpatialReward serves as a robust signal in online RL, boosting OmniGen2 by +0.90 on GEdit-Bench--surpassing the leading discriminative model and doubling the gain of GPT-4.1 (+0.45).

While parallelization offers scalability, existing hybrid CPU-GPU solvers face critical bottlenecks due to host-device synchronization latency and branch divergence on SIMT architectures, limiting their utility for real-time planning and hindering real-robot deployment. We present Vec-QMDP, a CPU-native parallel planner that aligns POMDP search with modern CPUs' SIMD architecture, achieving $227\\times$--$1073\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art serial planners. Vec-QMDP adopts a Data-Oriented Design (DOD), refactoring scattered, pointer-based data structures into contiguous, cache-efficient memory layouts. We further introduce a hierarchical parallelism scheme: distributing sub-trees across independent CPU cores and SIMD lanes, enabling fully vectorized tree expansion and collision checking. Efficiency is maximized with the help of UCB load balancing across trees and a vectorized STR-tree for coarse-level collision checking.

This work explores an alternative axis: increasing per-token computation without expanding parameters, by internalizing latent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) into pretraining. We propose Pretraining with Token-Level Adaptive Latent CoT (adaptive latent CoT), where the model generates a variable-length latent CoT trajectory before emitting each token -- allocating longer trajectories to difficult tokens and shorter (or even zero) trajectories to easy ones. Importantly, this behavior emerges naturally from one-stage pretraining on general text and reduces computation in both training and inference via token-wise adaptive halting.

We compile this novel integrated GWD archive by merging multiple publicly available datasets into a single, unified resource. This GWD archive offers consistent labeling, improved domain diversity, and more balanced class representation, enabling the development of robust and generalizable waste recognition models. Additional preprocessing steps such as quality filtering, duplicate removal, and metadata generation further improve dataset reliability.

Unlike standard locomotion or static manipulation, this task demands a seamless integration of explosive whole-body coordination and precise, timing-critical interception. While recent advances have achieved lifelike motion mimicry, bridging the gap between kinematic imitation and functional, physics-aware striking without compromising stylistic naturalness is non-trivial. To address this, we propose Imitation-to-Interaction, a progressive reinforcement learning framework designed to evolve a robot from a \"mimic\" to a capable \"striker.\" Our approach establishes a robust motor prior from human data, distills it into a compact, model-based state representation, and stabilizes dynamics via adversarial priors. Crucially, to overcome the sparsity of expert demonstrations, we introduce a manifold expansion strategy that generalizes discrete strike points into a dense interaction volume. We validate our framework through the mastery of diverse skills, including lifts and drop shots, in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the first zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of anthropomorphic badminton skills to a humanoid robot, successfully replicating the kinetic elegance and functional precision of human athletes in the physical world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u7fbd\u6bdb\u7403\u7b49\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u4f53\u80b2\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u8eab\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u7cbe\u51c6\u6253\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u7fbd\u6bdb\u7403\u7b49\u4f53\u80b2\u8fd0\u52a8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u8fdc\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7206\u53d1\u529b\u3001\u51fb\u7403\u65f6\u673a\u7cbe\u51c6\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u81ea\u7136\u534f\u8c03\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u878d\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u5f62\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201cImitation-to-Interaction\u201d\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u538b\u7f29\uff1b3\uff09\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u7a33\u5b9a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b4\uff09\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u63d0\u51fa\u6d41\u5f62\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u51fb\u7403\u70b9\u6cdb\u5316\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u4ea4\u4e92\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u514b\u670d\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u7a00\u758f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6280\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u6311\u7403\u3001\u6413\u7403\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u7684\u638c\u63e1\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u4eba\u5f62\u7fbd\u6bdb\u7403\u8fd0\u52a8\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5177\u5907\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f18\u96c5\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u51c6\u51fb\u7403\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u7c7b\u4eba\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f53\u80b2\u6280\u80fd\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose CoRect (Context-Aware Logit Contrast for Hidden State Rectification). By contrasting logits from contextualized and non-contextualized forward passes, CoRect identifies layers that exhibit high parametric bias without requiring ground-truth labels.

Project page:https://bimanibench.github.io/", "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced embodied AI, and using them to benchmark robotic intelligence has become a pivotal trend. However, existing frameworks remain predominantly confined to single-arm manipulation, failing to capture the spatio-temporal coordination required for bimanual tasks like lifting a heavy pot. To address this, we introduce BiManiBench, a hierarchical benchmark evaluating MLLMs across three tiers: fundamental spatial reasoning, high-level action planning, and low-level end-effector control. Our framework isolates unique bimanual challenges, such as arm reachability and kinematic constraints, thereby distinguishing perceptual hallucinations from planning failures. Analysis of over 30 state-of-the-art models reveals that despite high-level reasoning proficiency, MLLMs struggle with dual-arm spatial grounding and control, frequently resulting in mutual interference and sequencing errors. These findings suggest the current paradigm lacks a deep understanding of mutual kinematic constraints, highlighting the need for future research to focus on inter-arm collision-avoidance and fine-grained temporal sequencing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BiManiBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5728\u53cc\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MLLMs\u5df2\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5355\u81c2\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u53cc\u81c2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u53cc\u81c2\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86BiManiBench\u5206\u5c42\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ece\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u5230\u672b\u7aef\u6267\u884c\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9898\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u611f\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u5931\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u4e13\u95e8\u8003\u5bdf\u53cc\u81c2\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8d85\u8fc730\u79cd\u524d\u6cbfMLLMs\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53cc\u81c2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6392\u5e8f\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dMLLM\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u53cc\u81c2\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u52a0\u5f3a\u5bf9\u53cc\u81c2\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u907f\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, exploration of this risk remains largely anecdotal, lacking concrete characterization and automated methods to proactively surface long-tail unintended behaviors under realistic CUA scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce the first conceptual and methodological framework for unintended CUA behaviors, by defining their key characteristics, automatically eliciting them, and analyzing how they arise from benign inputs. We propose AutoElicit: an agentic framework that iteratively perturbs benign instructions using CUA execution feedback, and elicits severe harms while keeping perturbations realistic and benign. Using AutoElicit, we surface hundreds of harmful unintended behaviors from state-of-the-art CUAs such as Claude 4.5 Haiku and Opus. We further evaluate the transferability of human-verified successful perturbations, identifying persistent susceptibility to unintended behaviors across various other frontier CUAs.

In this paper, we propose a brain-image alignment strategy that leverages multiple pre-trained visual encoders with distinct inductive biases to capture hierarchical and multi-scale visual representations, while employing a contrastive learning objective to achieve effective alignment between brain signals and visual embeddings. Furthermore, we introduce a Fusion Prior, which learns a stable mapping on large-scale visual data and subsequently matches brain features to this pre-trained prior, thereby enhancing distributional consistency across modalities.

We propose Graph-Loc, a graph-based localization framework that tracks the platform pose against compact structural map priors represented as a lightweight point-line graph. Such priors can be constructed from heterogeneous sources commonly available in practice, including polygon outlines vectorized from occupancy/grid maps and CAD/model/floor-plan layouts. For each incoming LiDAR scan, Graph-Loc extracts sparse point and line primitives to form an observation graph, retrieves a pose-conditioned visible subgraph via LiDAR ray simulation, and performs scan-to-map association through unbalanced optimal transport with a local graph-context regularizer. The unbalanced formulation relaxes mass conservation, improving robustness to missing, spurious, and fragmented structures under occlusion. To enhance stability in low-observability segments, we estimate information anisotropy from the refinement normal matrix and defer updates along weakly constrained directions until sufficient constraints reappear.

In this work, we investigate unsupervised approaches to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs, eliminating the need for heavy human annotations or teacher models' supervision. Specifically, we first replace a few paragraphs with special placeholders in a long document. LLMs are trained through reinforcement learning to reconstruct the document by correctly identifying and sequencing missing paragraphs from a set of candidate options. This training paradigm enables the model to capture global narrative coherence, significantly boosting long-context performance. We validate the effectiveness of our method on two widely used benchmarks, RULER and LongBench~v2. While acquiring noticeable gains on RULER, it can also achieve a reasonable improvement on LongBench~v2 without any manually curated long-context QA data.

Implicit methods, on the other hand, capture high-level implicit motion semantics directly from the driving video, but suffer from identity leakage and entanglement between motion and appearance.

This capability enables embodied AI agents to perform complex tasks, without involvement of an expert, making human-robot interaction (HRI) more convenient. However these developments raise significant security and privacy challenges such as self-preferencing, where a single LLM service provider dominates the market and uses this power to promote their own preferences. LLM oracles have been recently proposed as a mechanism to decentralize LLMs by executing multiple LLMs from different vendors and aggregating their outputs to obtain a more reliable and trustworthy final result. However, the accuracy of these approaches highly depends on the aggregation method. The current aggregation methods mostly use semantic similarity between various LLM outputs, not suitable for robotic task planning, where the temporal order of tasks is important. To fill the gap, we propose an LLM oracle with a new aggregation method for robotic task planning. In addition, we propose a decentralized multi-robot infrastructure based on Hyperledger Fabric that can host the proposed oracle. The proposed infrastructure enables users to express their natural language intent to the system, which then can be decomposed into subtasks.

While prior work observed that convexity and efficiency co-occur in color naming, the analytical relation between them and why they co-occur have not been well understood. We address this gap by combining analytical and empirical analyses that build on the Information Bottleneck (IB) framework for semantic efficiency. First, we show that convexity and efficiency are distinct in the sense that neither entails the other: there are convex systems which are inefficient, and optimally-efficient systems that are non-convex. Crucially, however, the IB-optimal systems are mostly convex in the domain of color naming, explaining the main empirical basis for the convexity approach. Second, we show that efficiency is a stronger predictor for discriminating attested color naming systems from hypothetical variants, with convexity adding negligible improvement on top of that. Finally, we discuss a range of empirical phenomena that convexity cannot account for but efficiency can. Taken together, our work suggests that while convexity and efficiency can yield similar structural observations, they are fundamentally distinct, with efficiency providing a more comprehensive account of semantic typology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u7279\u6027\u2014\u2014\u51f8\u6027\u4e0e\u4ea4\u6d41\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e8c\u8005\u867d\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u4e49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u989c\u8272\u547d\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u51f8\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u4e0e\u5171\u73b0\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u4e0d\u660e\u6670\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4e24\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u5404\u81ea\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\uff08IB\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u68c0\u9a8c\u51f8\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u989c\u8272\u547d\u540d\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u548c\u5047\u60f3\u547d\u540d\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u51f8\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e92\u4e0d\u8574\u542b\u3002\u5b58\u5728\u51f8\u4f46\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e5f\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u4f46\u4e0d\u51f8\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u30022\uff09\u5728\u989c\u8272\u547d\u540d\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u9ad8\u6548\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u4e3a\u51f8\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u51f8\u6027\u73b0\u8c61\u30023\uff09\u6548\u7387\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5224\u522b\u529b\u5927\u4e8e\u51f8\u6027\uff0c\u51f8\u6027\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u8d21\u732e\u5f88\u5c0f\u30024\uff09\u4e00\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u4ec5\u6548\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51f8\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u867d\u5e38\u5171\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u4e92\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u6548\u7387\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u578b\u5b66\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \\textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency.

However, existing methods for bimanual manipulation often rely on costly data collection and training, struggling to generalize to unseen objects in novel categories efficiently. In this paper, we present Bi-Adapt, a novel framework designed for efficient generalization for bimanual manipulation via semantic correspondence. Bi-Adapt achieves cross-category affordance mapping by leveraging the strong capability of vision foundation models. Fine-tuning with restricted data on novel categories, Bi-Adapt exhibits notable generalization to out-of-category objects in a zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate its high efficiency, achieving a high success rate on different benchmark tasks across novel categories with limited data.

In this study, we propose a bionic stabilized localization system based on CA-YOLO, designed to enhance both target localization accuracy and small target recognition capabilities. Acting as the \"brain\" of the system, the target detection algorithm emulates the visual focusing mechanism of animals by integrating bionic modules into the YOLO backbone network. These modules include the introduction of a small target detection head and the development of a Characteristic Fusion Attention Mechanism (CFAM). Furthermore, drawing inspiration from the human Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), a bionic pan-tilt tracking control strategy is developed, which incorporates central positioning, stability optimization, adaptive control coefficient adjustment, and an intelligent recapture function. The experimental results show that CA-YOLO outperforms the original model on standard datasets (COCO and VisDrone), with average accuracy metrics improved by 3.94%and 4.90%, respectively.Further time-sensitive target localization experiments validate the effectiveness and practicality of this bionic stabilized localization system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eCA-YOLO\u7684\u4eff\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbYOLO\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4eff\u751f\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5934\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08CFAM\uff09\uff1b\u5e76\u501f\u9274\u4eba\u7c7b\u524d\u5ead\u773c\u52a8\u53cd\u5c04\uff08VOR\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u5957\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u518d\u6355\u83b7\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u4eff\u751f\u4e91\u53f0\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO\u548cVisDrone\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCA-YOLO\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e863.94%\u548c4.90%\uff1b\u65f6\u654f\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e5f\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u4eff\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u51c6\u5ea6\u548c\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

While large vision-language models (VLMs) trained on web-scale data offer powerful common-sense reasoning, they lack the grounded experience necessary for safe vehicle control. We posit that an effective autonomous agent should leverage the world knowledge of VLMs to guide a steerable driving policy toward robust control in driving scenarios. To this end, we propose SteerVLA, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of VLMs to produce fine-grained language instructions that steer a vision-language-action (VLA) driving policy. Key to our method is this rich language interface between the high-level VLM and low-level VLA, which allows the high-level policy to more effectively ground its reasoning in the control outputs of the low-level policy. To provide fine-grained language supervision aligned with vehicle control, we leverage a VLM to augment existing driving data with detailed language annotations, which we find to be essential for effective reasoning and steerability. We evaluate SteerVLA on a challenging closed-loop benchmark, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.77 points in overall driving score and by 8.04 points on a long-tail subset.

At the heart of this process is not just the ability to communicate but also the remarkable flexibility in how we can express ourselves. We can express the same thoughts in virtually infinite ways using different words and structures - this ability to rephrase and reformulate expressions is known as paraphrase. Modeling paraphrases is a keystone to meaning in computational language models; being able to construct different variations of texts that convey the same meaning or not shows strong abilities of semantic understanding. If computational language models are to represent meaning, they must understand and control the different aspects that construct the same meaning as opposed to different meanings at a fine granularity. Yet most existing approaches reduce paraphrasing to a binary decision between two texts or to producing a single rewrite of a source, obscuring which linguistic factors are responsible for meaning preservation. In this thesis, I propose that decomposing paraphrases into their constituent linguistic aspects (paraphrase types) offers a more fine-grained and cognitively grounded view of semantic equivalence. I show that even advanced machine learning models struggle with this task. Yet, when explicitly trained on paraphrase types, models achieve stronger performance on related paraphrase tasks and downstream applications. For example, in plagiarism detection, language models trained on paraphrase types surpass human baselines: 89.6% accuracy compared to 78.4% for plagiarism cases from Wikipedia, and 66.5% compared to 55.7% for plagiarism of scientific papers from arXiv. In identifying duplicate questions on Quora, models trained with paraphrase types improve over models trained on binary pairs.

This paper proposes a structured heuristic recovery control law that jointly commands steering and tractive force for a generalized single-track Ackermann vehicle model. The formulation explicitly accounts for time-varying longitudinal velocity in the lateral-yaw dynamics and retains nonlinear steering-coupled interaction terms that are commonly simplified in the literature. Unlike approaches that assume constant longitudinal speed, the proposed design targets the transient post-impact regime where speed variations and nonlinear coupling significantly influence recovery. The method is evaluated in simulation on the proposed generalized single-track model and a standard 3DOF single-track reference model in MATLAB, demonstrating consistent post-collision restoration behaviour across representative initial post-impact conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u53d1\u751f\u78b0\u649e\u540e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u8f6c\u5411\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u78b0\u649e\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f66\u8f86\u51fa\u73b0\u6a2a\u5411\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u504f\u822a\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u77ac\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u82e5\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ca\u65f6\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u7eb5\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u78b0\u649e\u540e\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u63d0\u51fa\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6062\u590d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u5355\u8f68Ackermann\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u53d8\u7eb5\u5411\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8f6c\u5411\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8026\u5408\u7684\u6a2a\u6446\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u878d\u5408\u8f6c\u5411\u4e0e\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6062\u590d\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\u3002\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\u548cMATLAB\u6807\u51c63\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8f66\u8f86\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u78b0\u649e\u540e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5ffd\u7565\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9879\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5f8b\u80fd\u591f\u9488\u5bf9\u78b0\u649e\u540e\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5de5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A Probabilistic Perspective on the Emergence of Reasoning in RLVR", "comment": "15 pages", "summary": "Whether Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) endows Large Language Models (LLMs) with new capabilities or merely elicits latent traces remains a central debate. In this work, we align with the former view, proposing a probabilistic framework where capability is defined by instance-level solvability. We hypothesize that the emergence of complex reasoning can be driven by sharpening atomic step probabilities, which enables models to overcome the exponential decay of success rates inherent in multi-step reasoning chains. Utilizing the Algebrarium framework, we train models exclusively on single-step operations and evaluate their performance on unseen multi-step tasks. Our empirical results confirm that: (1) RLVR incentivizes the exploration of previously inaccessible solution paths by amplifying the model's existing skills; (2) composite performance is strictly governed by the joint probability of atomic steps, evidenced by high Pearson correlation coefficients ($\u03c1\\in [0.69, 0.96]$); and (3) RLVR, acting as a global optimizer, can cause specific skills to be sacrificed to maximize aggregate reward. Our work offers a novel explanation for emergent abilities in RLVR, suggesting that the iterative optimization of solvable problems enables models to develop the capabilities to tackle previously unsolvable scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86RLVR\uff08\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5b66\u754c\u4e89\u8bbaRLVR\u5230\u5e95\u662f\u6fc0\u53d1LLM\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u8fd8\u662f\u4ec5\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3aRLVR\u7684\u786e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5c42\u9762\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eAlgebrarium\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u6ca1\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(1) RLVR\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5176\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee5\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u89e3\u8def\u5f84\uff1b(2) \u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u7531\u539f\u5b50\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u9ad8\u8fbe0.69-0.96\uff1b(3) RLVR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u727a\u7272\u90e8\u5206\u6280\u80fd\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u603b\u4f53\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "conclusion": "RLVR\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u91caLLM\u5728RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

We employed the Global Context Vision Transformer (GCViT) architecture-tiny for cat breed recognition.

Experimental results show that the GCViT-Tiny model achieved a test accuracy of 92.00% and validation accuracy of 94.54%.

To unlock its potential value, entity and relation extraction for legal documents has emerged as a crucial task. However, existing methods often lack domain-specific knowledge and fail to account for the unique characteristics of the judicial domain. In this paper, we propose an entity and relation extraction algorithm based on hypergraph neural network (Legal-KAHRE) for drug-related judgment documents. Firstly, we design a candidate span generator based on neighbor-oriented packing strategy and biaffine mechanism, which identifies spans likely to contain entities. Secondly, we construct a legal dictionary with judicial domain knowledge and integrate it into text encoding representation using multi-head attention. Additionally, we incorporate domain-specific cases like joint crimes and combined punishment for multiple crimes into the hypergraph structure design. Finally, we employ a hypergraph neural network for higher-order inference via message passing.

However, single time-point segmentations fail to capture the biological heterogeneity and temporal evolution of stroke. We propose a bi-temporal analysis framework that characterizes ischemic tissue using statistical descriptors, radiomic texture features, and deep feature embeddings from two architectures (mJ-Net and nnU-Net). Bi-temporal refers to admission (T1) and post-treatment follow-up (T2). All features are extracted at T1 from CTP, with follow-up DWI aligned to ensure spatial correspondence. Manually delineated masks at T1 and T2 are intersected to construct six regions of interest (ROIs) encoding both initial tissue state and final outcome. Features were aggregated per region and analyzed in feature space. Evaluation on 18 patients with successful reperfusion demonstrated meaningful clustering of region-level representations. Regions classified as penumbra or healthy at T1 that ultimately recovered exhibited feature similarity to preserved brain tissue, whereas infarct-bound regions formed distinct groupings. Both baseline GLCM and deep embeddings showed a similar trend: penumbra regions exhibit features that are significantly different depending on final state, whereas this difference is not significant for core regions. Deep feature spaces, particularly mJ-Net, showed strong separation between salvageable and non-salvageable tissue, with a penumbra separation index that differed significantly from zero (Wilcoxon signed-rank test). These findings suggest that encoder-derived feature manifolds reflect underlying tissue phenotypes and state transitions, providing insight into imaging-based quantification of stroke evolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u65f6\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6025\u6027\u8111\u5352\u4e2d\u60a3\u8005\u7f3a\u8840\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf918\u4f8b\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u6551\u6cbb\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6551\u6cbb\u8111\u533a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u505a\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u65f6\u70b9\u5f71\u50cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5352\u4e2d\u7f3a\u8840\u533a\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u53ca\u5352\u4e2d\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f14\u53d8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u591a\u65f6\u70b9\u3001\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u523b\u753b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8111\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5352\u4e2d\u540e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u65f6\u70b9\uff08\u5165\u9662CTP\u4e0e\u672f\u540eDWI\uff09\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u540c\u4e00\u533a\u57df\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u4ea4\u96c6\uff0c\u5f62\u62106\u4e2a\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff08ROI\uff09\u3002\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53d6\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u4e24\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08mJ-Net\u3001nnU-Net\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u5206\u6790\u5404\u533a\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u53ca\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff08\u5305\u62ecWilcoxon\u79e9\u548c\u68c0\u9a8c\uff09\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u4f4d\u6210\u529f\u518d\u901a\u7684\u5352\u4e2d\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u533a\u7279\u5f81\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u805a\u7c7b\u3002\u521d\u59cb\u4e3a\u534a\u6697\u5e26\u4f46\u6700\u7ec8\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6062\u590d\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5065\u5eb7\u8111\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff1b\u800c\u6700\u7ec8\u6897\u6b7b\u533a\u57df\u805a\u4e3a\u4e00\u7c7b\u3002\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u8fd8\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u534a\u6697\u5e26\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u5176\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u5c40\u6709\u5173\uff0c\u4f46\u6838\u5fc3\u533a\u7684\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u3002mJ-Net\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u53ef\u6551\u6cbb\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u6551\u6cbb\u7ec4\u7ec7\u533a\u5206\u6548\u679c\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u53cc\u65f6\u70b9\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u53cd\u6620\u5352\u4e2d\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5352\u4e2d\u6210\u50cf\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u4e3a\u5352\u4e2d\u6f14\u53d8\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6cbb\u7597\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

While recent advances in pose estimation have significantly improved numerical accuracy, practical robotic systems still suffer from frequent execution failures even when pose estimates appear accurate. This gap suggests that pose accuracy alone is insufficient to guarantee execution-level reliability. In this paper, we reveal that such failures arise from a deterministic geometric error amplification mechanism, in which small pose estimation errors are magnified through system structure and motion execution, leading to unstable or failed alignment. Rather than modifying pose estimation algorithms, we propose a Reliability-aware Execution Gating mechanism that operates at the execution level. The proposed approach evaluates geometric consistency and configuration risk before execution, and selectively rejects or scales high-risk pose updates. We validate the proposed method on a real UR5 robotic platform performing single-step visual alignment tasks under varying camera-target distances and off-axis configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed execution gating significantly improves task success rates, reduces execution variance, and suppresses tail-risk behavior, while leaving average pose accuracy largely unchanged. Importantly, the proposed mechanism is estimator-agnostic and can be readily integrated with both classical geometry-based and learning-based pose estimation pipelines. These results highlight the importance of execution-level reliability modeling and provide a practical solution for improving robustness in near-field vision-guided robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7cbe\u5bc6\u5bf9\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u5df2\u8f83\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u7cbe\u51c6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u5931\u8d25\u4ecd\u9891\u7e41\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u4e0d\u7b49\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6267\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u65b0\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u653e\u5927\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u8d77\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\"\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6267\u884c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\"\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u914d\u7f6e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5bf9\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4f4d\u59ff\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u62d2\u7edd\u6216\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u969c\u6267\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645UR5\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u6781\u7aef\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u800c\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u666e\u9002\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u53ca\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u9760\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6267\u884c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u8fd1\u573a\u89c6\u89c9\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We present a unified theoretical framework for analyzing the effect of arbitrary contextual information in Transformer-based LLMs. Our analysis characterizes contextual influence through output error dynamics. In a single-layer Transformer, we prove that the context-conditioned error vector decomposes additively into the baseline error vector and a contextual correction vector. This yields necessary geometric conditions for error reduction: the contextual correction must align with the negative baseline error and satisfy a norm constraint. We further show that the contextual correction norm admits an explicit upper bound determined by context-query relevance and complementarity. These results extend to multi-context and multi-layer Transformers. Experiments across ICL, retrieval-augmented generation, and memory evolution validate our theory and motivate a principled context selection strategy that improves performance by $0.6\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u610f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9Transformer\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u51e0\u4f55\u89d2\u5ea6\u63ed\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u6f14\u793a\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\uff09\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u673a\u5236\u4ec5\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982ICL\uff09\u6709\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u666e\u9002\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3aLLMs\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u8f93\u51fa\u8bef\u5dee\u52a8\u6001\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u5c42Transformer\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bef\u5dee\u9879\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754c\u3002\u8be5\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u591a\u5c42Transformer\uff0c\u516c\u5f0f\u660e\u786e\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u4e0e\u8d1f\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c0f\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u8303\u6570\u4e0a\u754c\u7531\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728ICL\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6f14\u5316\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u53470.6%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9LLMs\u63a8\u7406\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, global alignment is easily dominated by non-diagnostic information, while local alignment fails to integrate key diagnostic evidence. As a result, learning reliable diagnostic representations becomes difficult, which limits their applicability in medical scenarios with limited paired data. To address this issue, we propose an LLM-Guided Diagnostic Evidence Alignment method (LGDEA), which shifts the pretraining objective toward evidence-level alignment that is more consistent with the medical diagnostic process.

Therefore, this study categorizes and analyzes the characteristics of muscles, as well as their management and utilization methods, based on the various research conducted on the musculoskeletal humanoids we have developed, Kengoro and Musashi. We classify the features of the musculoskeletal structure into five properties: Redundancy, Independency, Anisotropy, Variable Moment Arm, and Nonlinear Elasticity. We then organize the diverse advantages and disadvantages of musculoskeletal humanoids that arise from the combination of these properties.

As the conclusive written instrument issued by a court, a judgment document embodies complex legal reasoning. However, existing methods often oversimplify this complex process, particularly by omitting the ``Pre-Judge'' phase, a crucial step where human judges form a preliminary conclusion. This omission leads to two core challenges: 1) the ineffective acquisition of foundational judicial elements, and 2) the inadequate modeling of the Pre-Judge process, which collectively undermine the final document's legal soundness. To address these challenges, we propose \\textit{\\textbf{J}udicial \\textbf{U}nified \\textbf{S}ynthesis \\textbf{T}hrough \\textbf{I}ntermediate \\textbf{C}onclusion \\textbf{E}mulation} (JUSTICE), a novel framework that emulates the ``Search $\\rightarrow$ Pre-Judge $\\rightarrow$ Write'' cognitive workflow of human judges. Specifically, it introduces the Pre-Judge stage through three dedicated components: Referential Judicial Element Retriever (RJER), Intermediate Conclusion Emulator (ICE), and Judicial Unified Synthesizer (JUS). RJER first retrieves legal articles and a precedent case to establish a referential foundation. ICE then operationalizes the Pre-Judge phase by generating a verifiable intermediate conclusion. Finally, JUS synthesizes these inputs to craft the final judgment. Experiments on both an in-domain legal benchmark and an out-of-distribution dataset show that JUSTICE significantly outperforms strong baselines, with substantial gains in legal accuracy, including a 4.6\\% improvement in prison term prediction. Our findings underscore the importance of explicitly modeling the Pre-Judge process to enhance the legal coherence and accuracy of generated judgment documents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u53f8\u6cd5\u6587\u4e66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u53f8\u6cd5\u6587\u4e66\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u6cd5\u5b98\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\"\u9884\u5224\u65ad\uff08Pre-Judge\uff09\"\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6587\u4e66\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u540d\u4e3aJUSTICE\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6cd5\u5b98\"\u67e5\u627e\u2192\u9884\u5224\u65ad\u2192\u64b0\u5199\"\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u5927\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u53c2\u8003\u53f8\u6cd5\u8981\u7d20\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\uff08RJER\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6761\u6587\u548c\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u9884\u5224\u7ed3\u8bba\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff08ICE\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7531\u7edf\u4e00\u5408\u6210\u5668\uff08JUS\uff09\u6574\u5408\u6240\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u5224\u51b3\u6587\u4e66\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cJUSTICE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5211\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u4e864.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\"\u9884\u5224\u65ad\"\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u53f8\u6cd5\u6587\u4e66\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u903b\u8f91\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Project page: https://leonieschuessler.github.io/mufasa/", "summary": "Unsupervised object-centric learning (OCL) decomposes visual scenes into distinct entities. Slot attention is a popular approach that represents individual objects as latent vectors, called slots. Current methods obtain these slot representations solely from the last layer of a pre-trained vision transformer (ViT), ignoring valuable, semantically rich information encoded across the other layers. To better utilize this latent semantic information, we introduce MUFASA, a lightweight plug-and-play framework for slot attention-based approaches to unsupervised object segmentation.

Existing work like UniDomain effectively learns symbolic manipulation domains from real-world demonstrations, described in Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and has successfully applied them to real-world tasks. These domains, however, are restricted to tabletop manipulation. We propose UniPlan, a vision-language task planning system for long-horizon mobile-manipulation in large-scale indoor environments, that unifies scene topology, visuals, and robot capabilities into a holistic PDDL representation. UniPlan programmatically extends learned tabletop domains from UniDomain to support navigation, door traversal, and bimanual coordination. It operates on a visual-topological map, comprising navigation landmarks anchored with scene images. Given a language instruction, UniPlan retrieves task-relevant nodes from the map and uses a VLM to ground the anchored image into task-relevant objects and their PDDL states; next, it reconnects these nodes to a compressed, densely-connected topological map, also represented in PDDL, with connectivity and costs derived from the original map; Finally, a mobile-manipulation plan is generated using off-the-shelf PDDL solvers. Evaluated on human-raised tasks in a large-scale map with real-world imagery, UniPlan significantly outperforms VLM and LLM+PDDL planning in success rate, plan quality, and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UniPlan\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5ba4\u5185\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982UniDomain\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u684c\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u9700\u8981\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u5f00\u95e8\u3001\u53cc\u624b\u534f\u8c03\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u73af\u5883\u66f4\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u5ba4\u5185\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "UniPlan\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u62d3\u6251\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u5230PDDL\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eceUniDomain\u7684\u684c\u9762\u9886\u57df\u6269\u5c55\u652f\u6301\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u95e8\u7a7f\u8d8a\u53ca\u53cc\u624b\u534f\u4f5c\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u62d3\u6251\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7VLM\u8bc6\u522b\u7269\u4f53\u53ca\u5176PDDL\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u518d\u91cd\u8fde\u5f62\u6210\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u9ad8\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u62d3\u6251\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709PDDL\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5ba4\u5185\u5730\u56fe\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0eVLM\u3001LLM+PDDL\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0cUniPlan\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "UniPlan\u5145\u5206\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u64cd\u4f5c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u684c\u9762\u64cd\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

This study investigates the intrinsic few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) capabilities of frozen DINOv3 features through a training-free baseline, FSSDINO, utilizing class-specific prototypes and Gram-matrix refinement. Our results across binary, multi-class, and cross-domain (CDFSS) benchmarks demonstrate that this minimal approach, applied to the final backbone layer, is highly competitive with specialized methods involving complex decoders or test-time adaptation. Crucially, we conduct an Oracle-guided layer analysis, identifying a significant performance gap between the standard last-layer features and globally optimal intermediate representations. We reveal a \"Safest vs. Optimal\" dilemma: while the Oracle proves higher performance is attainable, matching the results of compute-intensive adaptation methods, current unsupervised and support-guided selection metrics consistently yield lower performance than the last-layer baseline. This characterizes a \"Semantic Selection Gap\" in Foundation Models, a disconnect where traditional heuristics fail to reliably identify high-fidelity features. Our work establishes the \"Last-Layer\" as a deceptively strong baseline and provides a rigorous diagnostic of the latent semantic potentials in DINOv3.The code is publicly available at https://github.com/hussni0997/fssdino.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5FSSDINO\uff0c\u4ec5\u5229\u7528DINOv3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51bb\u7ed3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7c7b\u522b\u539f\u578b\u4e0eGram\u77e9\u9635\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u81ea\u76d1\u7763ViT\u5982DINOv3\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4e30\u5bcc\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u4e8e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u4e86\u89e3\u51bb\u7ed3\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5728FSS\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u5176\u6781\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFSSDINO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3DINOv3\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u539f\u578b\u548cGram\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u7528Oracle\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u6790\u5404\u5c42\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "FSSDINO\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u53ca\u8de8\u57dfFSS\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u6216\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002Oracle\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u652f\u6301\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u51bb\u7ed3DINOv3\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u662f\u6781\u5f3a\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u9009\u62e9\u9e3f\u6c9f\u201d\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u6316\u6398\u6f5c\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its strength in such settings, it may struggle to sufficiently explore and discover complex manipulation strategies, especially in sparse-reward settings. Our approach is based on the idea of a lower-dimensional manifold of feasible, likely-visited states during such manipulation and to guide RL with a sampler from this manifold. We propose Sample-Guided RL, which uses model-based constraint solvers to efficiently sample feasible configurations (satisfying differentiable collision, contact, and force constraints) and leverage them to guide RL for universal (goal-conditioned) manipulation policies. We study using this data directly to bias state visitation, as well as using black-box optimization of open-loop trajectories between random configurations to impose a state bias and optionally add a behavior cloning loss. In a minimalistic double sphere manipulation setting, Sample-Guided RL discovers complex manipulation strategies and achieves high success rates in reaching any statically stable state. In a more challenging panda arm setting, our approach achieves a significant success rate over a near-zero baseline, and demonstrates a breadth of complex whole-body-contact manipulation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u8f85\u52a9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u53ef\u884c\u521d\u6001\u8fbe\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u53ef\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u901a\u7528\u64cd\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a5\u89e6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7531\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faSample-Guided RL\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u6ee1\u8db3\u78b0\u649e\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u548c\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u53ef\u884c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9ed1\u76d2\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u53ca\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u901a\u7528\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6RL\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u91c7\u6837\u6570\u636e\u504f\u7f6e\u72b6\u6001\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u5f00\u73af\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u968f\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u201c\u53cc\u7403\u201d\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b66\u4f1a\u590d\u6742\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002\u5728\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684Panda\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdc\u8d85\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e3a\u96f6\uff09\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5168\u8eab\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8f83\u9ad8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u6837\u590d\u6742\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a generative framework to simultaneously address multiple intent detection and slot filling. In particular, an attention-over-attention decoder is proposed to handle the variable number of intents and the interference between the two sub-tasks by incorporating an inductive bias into the process of multi-task learning. Besides, we construct two new multi-intent SLU datasets based on single-intent utterances by taking advantage of the next sentence prediction (NSP) head of the BERT model.

However, existing training-free methods often rely on rigid visual feature injection, creating a conflict between identity fidelity and textual adaptability. To address this, we propose FlexID, a novel training-free framework utilizing intent-aware modulation. FlexID orthogonally decouples identity into two dimensions: a Semantic Identity Projector (SIP) that injects high-level priors into the language space, and a Visual Feature Anchor (VFA) that ensures structural fidelity within the latent space. Crucially, we introduce a Context-Aware Adaptive Gating (CAG) mechanism that dynamically modulates the weights of these streams based on editing intent and diffusion timesteps. By automatically relaxing rigid visual constraints when strong editing intent is detected, CAG achieves synergy between identity preservation and semantic variation. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that FlexID achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity consistency and text adherence, offering an efficient solution for complex narrative generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5FlexID\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7269\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u50f5\u786c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u6587\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u80dc\u4efb\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u7f16\u8f91\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlexID\uff0c\u5c06\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6295\u5f71\uff08SIP\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u951a\u70b9\uff08VFA\uff09\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\uff08CAG\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7f16\u8f91\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u957f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e24\u6761\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002", "result": "\u5728IBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cFlexID\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6587\u672c\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u53d9\u4e8b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexID\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u7f16\u8f91\u610f\u56fe\u4e0b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Specifically, Thinking States generates sequences of thinking tokens every few input tokens, transforms the thoughts back into embedding space, and adds them to the following input tokens. This has two key advantages. First, it captures the recurrent nature of CoT, but where the thought tokens are generated as input is processing. Second, since the thoughts are represented as tokens, they can be learned from natural language supervision, and using teacher-forcing, which is parallelizable. Empirically, Thinking States outperforms other latent reasoning methods on multiple reasoning tasks, narrowing the gap to CoT on math problems, and matching its performance on 2-Hop QA with improved latency.

Existing methods either (i) use end-to-end trained models with vision-language embeddings, which struggle to generalize beyond training data and lack action-level explainability, or (ii) rely on modular zero-shot pipelines with large language models (LLMs) and open-set object detectors, which suffer from error propagation, high computational cost, and difficulty integrating their reasoning back into the navigation policy. To this end, we propose a compact 3B-parameter Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agent that performs human-like embodied reasoning for both object recognition and action selection, removing the need for stitched multi-model pipelines. Instead of raw embedding matching, our agent employs explicit image-grounded reasoning to directly answer \"Is this the target object?\" and \"Why should I take this action?\" The reasoning process unfolds in three stages: \"think\", \"think summary\", and \"action\", yielding improved explainability, stronger generalization, and more efficient navigation.

To bridge the sim-to-real interface gap without sacrificing generality, MOSAIC then performs rapid residual adaptation: an interface-specific policy is trained using minimal interface-specific data, and then distilled into the general tracker through an additive residual module, outperforming naive fine-tuning or continual learning.

However, the actual effect of reasoning on visual synthesis remains unclear. We present UReason, a diagnostic benchmark for reasoning-driven image generation that evaluates whether reasoning can be faithfully executed in pixels. UReason contains 2,000 instances across five task families: Code, Arithmetic, Spatial, Attribute, and Text reasoning. To isolate the role of reasoning traces, we introduce an evaluation framework comparing direct generation, reasoning-guided generation, and de-contextualized generation which conditions only on the refined prompt. Across eight open-source unified models, we observe a consistent Reasoning Paradox: Reasoning traces generally improve performance over direct generation, yet retaining intermediate thoughts as conditioning context often hinders visual synthesis, and conditioning only on the refined prompt yields substantial gains. Our analysis suggests that the bottleneck lies in contextual interference rather than insufficient reasoning capacity.

SIGMA introduces selective multi-attribute tokens, including style, content, subject, and identity tokens, which allow the model to interpret and compose multiple visual conditions in an interleaved text-image sequence. Through post-training on the Bagel unified backbone with 700K interleaved examples, SIGMA supports compositional editing, selective attribute transfer, and fine-grained multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments show that SIGMA improves controllability, cross-condition consistency, and visual quality across diverse editing and generation tasks, with substantial gains over Bagel on compositional tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIGMA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c5e\u6027token\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u4ea4\u9519\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u5143\u5c5e\u6027\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Bagel\uff09\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u5355\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u591a\u6e90\u5f02\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "SIGMA\u6846\u67b6\u5728Bagel\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u98ce\u683c\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u4e3b\u4f53\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u7b49\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u591a\u5c5e\u6027token\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u4ea4\u9519\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7700K\u7684\u4ea4\u9519\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u7ec4\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cSIGMA\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8f83Bagel\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "SIGMA\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Previous works often rely on heavy, expensive force sensors unsuitable for typical quadrotor platforms, or perform grasping without force feedback, risking damage to fragile objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel force-aware grasping framework incorporating six low-cost, sensitive skin-like tactile sensors. We introduce a magnetic-based tactile sensing module that provides high-precision three-dimensional force measurements. We eliminate geomagnetic interference through a reference Hall sensor and simplify the calibration process compared to previous work. The proposed framework enables precise force-aware grasping control, allowing safe manipulation of fragile objects and real-time weight measurement of grasped items. The system is validated through comprehensive real-world experiments, including balloon grasping, dynamic load variation tests, and ablation studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in various aerial manipulation scenarios. Our approach achieves fully onboard operation without external motion capture systems, significantly enhancing the practicality of force-sensitive aerial manipulation.

We introduce \\textbf{WorldTravel}, a benchmark comprising 150 real-world travel scenarios across 5 cities that demand navigating an average of 15+ interdependent temporal and logical constraints. To evaluate agents in realistic deployments, we develop \\textbf{WorldTravel-Webscape}, a multi-modal environment featuring over 2,000 rendered webpages where agents must perceive constraint parameters directly from visual layouts to inform their planning. Our evaluation of 10 frontier models reveals a significant performance collapse: even the state-of-the-art GPT-5.2 achieves only 32.67\\% feasibility in text-only settings, which plummets to 19.33\\% in multi-modal environments. We identify a critical Perception-Action Gap and a Planning Horizon threshold at approximately 10 constraints where model reasoning consistently fails, suggesting that perception and reasoning remain independent bottlenecks.

Gait recognition provides a practical alternative, as it can be captured reliably at a distance. To promote progress in gait recognition and provide a fair evaluation platform, the International Competition on Human Identification at a Distance (HID) has been organized annually since 2020. Since 2023, the competition has adopted the challenging SUSTech-Competition dataset, which features substantial variations in clothing, carried objects, and view angles. No dedicated training data are provided, requiring participants to train their models using external datasets. Each year, the competition applies a different random seed to generate distinct evaluation splits, which reduces the risk of overfitting and supports a fair assessment of cross-domain generalization. While HID 2023 and HID 2024 already used this dataset, HID 2025 explicitly examined whether algorithmic advances could surpass the accuracy limits observed previously. Despite the heightened difficulty, participants achieved further improvements, and the best-performing method reached 94.2% accuracy, setting a new benchmark on this dataset.

We argue this stems from mimicking raw trajectories without understanding the underlying intent. To address this, we propose explicitly disentangling behavior intent from execution details in end-2-end IL: \\textit{``Mimic Intent, Not just Trajectories'' (MINT)}. We achieve this via \\textit{multi-scale frequency-space tokenization}, which enforces a spectral decomposition of action chunk representation. We learn action tokens with a multi-scale coarse-to-fine structure, and force the coarsest token to capture low-frequency global structure and finer tokens to encode high-frequency details. This yields an abstract \\textit{Intent token} that facilitates planning and transfer, and multi-scale \\textit{Execution tokens} that enable precise adaptation to environmental dynamics. Building on this hierarchy, our policy generates trajectories through \\textit{next-scale autoregression}, performing progressive \\textit{intent-to-execution reasoning}, thus boosting learning efficiency and generalization. Crucially, this disentanglement enables \\textit{one-shot transfer} of skills, by simply injecting the Intent token from a demonstration into the autoregressive generation process.

Recent advancements in NLP, particularly through large language models (LLMs), have greatly improved outcomes in this field. This study introduces ViGoEmotions -- a Vietnamese emotion corpus comprising 20,664 social media comments in which each comment is classified into 27 fine-grained distinct emotions. To evaluate the quality of the dataset and its impact on emotion classification, eight pre-trained Transformer-based models were evaluated under three preprocessing strategies: preserving original emojis with rule-based normalization, converting emojis into textual descriptions, and applying ViSoLex, a model-based lexical normalization system. Results show that converting emojis into text often improves the performance of several BERT-based baselines, while preserving emojis yields the best results for ViSoBERT and CafeBERT. In contrast, removing emojis generally leads to lower performance. ViSoBERT achieved the highest Macro F1-score of 61.50% and Weighted F1-score of 63.26%. Strong performance was also observed from CafeBERT and PhoBERT.

While existing animal identification methods excel in controlled, single-camera settings, they face severe challenges regarding cross-camera generalization. When models trained on source cameras are deployed to new monitoring nodes characterized by divergent illumination, backgrounds, viewpoints, and heterogeneous imaging properties, recognition performance often degrades dramatically. This limits the large-scale application of non-contact technologies in dynamic, real-world farming environments. To address this challenge, this study proposes a cross-camera cow identification framework based on disentangled representation learning. This framework leverages the Subspace Identifiability Guarantee (SIG) theory in the context of bovine visual recognition. By modeling the underlying physical data generation process, we designed a principle-driven feature disentanglement module that decomposes observed images into multiple orthogonal latent subspaces. This mechanism effectively isolates stable, identity-related biometric features that remain invariant across cameras, thereby substantially improving generalization to unseen cameras. We constructed a high-quality dataset spanning five distinct camera nodes, covering heterogeneous acquisition devices and complex variations in lighting and angles. Extensive experiments across seven cross-camera tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 86.0%, significantly outperforming the Source-only Baseline (51.9%) and the strongest cross-camera baseline method (79.8%).

However, traditional modular pipelines often incur cumulative latency, whereas purely reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically provide limited formal safety guarantees. To bridge this gap, we propose an end-to-end RL framework augmented with model-based safety mechanisms. We incorporate physical priors in both training and deployment. During training, we design a physics-informed reward structure that provides global navigational guidance. During deployment, we integrate a real-time safety filter that projects the policy outputs onto a provably safe set to enforce strict collision-avoidance constraints. This hybrid architecture reconciles high-speed flight with robust safety assurances. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms both traditional planners and recent end-to-end obstacle avoidance approaches based on differentiable physics.

Code and models will be released", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in long-context processing, including quadratic computational costs, information forgetting, and the context fragmentation inherent in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We propose a cognitively inspired framework for efficient long-context inference based on chunk-wise compression and selective memory recall, rather than processing all raw tokens. The framework segments long inputs into chunks and encodes each chunk into compressed memory representations using a learned compressor. A gating module dynamically selects relevant memory blocks, which are then iteratively processed by a reasoning module with an evolving working memory to solve downstream tasks. The compressor and reasoner are jointly optimized via end-to-end reinforcement learning, while the gating module is trained separately as a classifier. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves competitive accuracy on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks such as RULER-HQA, extrapolates context length from 7K to 1.75M tokens, and offers a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared to strong long-context baselines. In particular, it achieves up to a 2 times reduction in peak GPU memory usage and a 6 times inference speedup over MemAgent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5757\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u56de\u8c03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u6587\u672c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8d85\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u5206\u5757(chunk)\uff0c\u6bcf\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5757\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u591a\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u5355\u72ec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6RULER-HQA\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u5177\u5907\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5c06\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u4ece7K\u62d3\u5c55\u52301.75M tokens\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u4f18\u6743\u8861\uff0cGPU\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u964d2\u500d\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53476\u500d\uff08\u76f8\u8f83MemAgent\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u6587\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5206\u5757\u538b\u7f29+\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5bf9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We present MammoColor, an end-to-end framework with a Task-Driven Chromatic Encoding (TDCE) module that converts single-channel mammograms into TDCE-encoded views for visual augmentation. Materials and Methods:MammoColor couples a lightweight TDCE module with a BI-RADS triage classifier and was trained end-to-end on VinDr-Mammo. Performance was evaluated on an internal test set, two public datasets (CBIS-DDSM and INBreast), and three external clinical cohorts. We also conducted a multi-reader, multi-case (MRMC) observer study with a washout period, comparing (1) grayscale-only, (2) TDCE-only, and (3) side-by-side grayscale+TDCE. Results:On VinDr-Mammo, MammoColor improved AUC from 0.7669 to 0.8461 (P=0.004). Gains were larger in dense breasts (AUC 0.749 to 0.835). In the MRMC study, TDCE-encoded images improved specificity (0.90 to 0.96; P=0.052) with comparable sensitivity.

Standard Behavior Cloning (BC), by mimicking the robot's executed trajectory, fundamentally ignores this compensatory mechanism. In this work, we propose a Dual-State Conditioning framework that shifts the learning objective to \"Intent Cloning\" (master command). We posit that the Intent-Execution Mismatch, the discrepancy between master command and slave response, is not noise, but a critical signal that physically encodes implicit interaction forces and algorithmically reveals the operator's strategy for overcoming system dynamics. By predicting the master intent, our policy learns to generate a \"virtual equilibrium point\", effectively realizing implicit impedance control. Furthermore, by explicitly conditioning on the history of this mismatch, the model performs implicit system identification, perceiving tracking errors as external forces to close the control loop. To bridge the temporal gap caused by inference latency, we further formulate the policy as a trajectory inpainter to ensure continuous control. We validate our approach on a sensorless, low-cost bi-manual setup. Empirical results across tasks requiring contact-rich manipulation and dynamic tracking reveal a decisive gap: while standard execution-cloning fails due to the inability to overcome contact stiffness and tracking lag, our mismatch-aware approach achieves robust success. This presents a minimalist behavior cloning framework for low-cost hardware, enabling force perception and dynamic compensation without relying on explicit force sensing.

Building on this paradigm, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) dLLMs with autoregressive (AR) initialization have further demonstrated strong performance competitive with mainstream AR models. However, we identify a fundamental mismatch between MoE architectures and diffusion-based decoding. Specifically, a large number of experts are activated at each denoising step, while only a small subset of tokens is ultimately accepted, resulting in substantial inference overhead and limiting their deployment in latency-sensitive applications. In this work, we propose TEAM, a plug-and-play framework that accelerates MoE dLLMs by enabling more accepted tokens with fewer activated experts. TEAM is motivated by the observation that expert routing decisions exhibit strong temporal consistency across denoising levels as well as spatial consistency across token positions. Leveraging these properties, TEAM employs three complementary expert activation and decoding strategies, conservatively selecting necessary experts for decoded and masked tokens and simultaneously performing aggressive speculative exploration across multiple candidates. Experimental results demonstrate that TEAM achieves up to 2.2x speedup over vanilla MoE dLLM, with negligible performance degradation.

In this work, we revisit the necessity of such dense visual processing and show that projected visual embeddings are already well-aligned with the language space, while effective vision-language interaction occurs in only a small subset of layers. Based on these insights, we propose ViCA (Vision-only Cross-Attention), a minimal MLLM architecture in which visual tokens bypass all self-attention and feed-forward layers, interacting with text solely through sparse cross-attention at selected layers. Extensive evaluations across three MLLM backbones, nine multimodal benchmarks, and 26 pruning-based baselines show that ViCA preserves 98% of baseline accuracy while reducing visual-side computation to 4%, consistently achieving superior performance-efficiency trade-offs. Moreover, ViCA provides a regular, hardware-friendly inference pipeline that yields over 3.5x speedup in single-batch inference and over 10x speedup in multi-batch inference, reducing visual grounding to near-zero overhead compared with text-only LLMs. It is also orthogonal to token pruning methods and can be seamlessly combined for further efficiency gains.

Existing methods typically employ coarse-grained attention as a proxy for block importance estimation, but often resort to expensive token-level searching or scoring, resulting in significant selection overhead. In this work, we trace the inaccuracy of standard coarse-grained attention via mean pooling to a theoretical root cause: the interaction between mean pooling and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We prove that mean pooling acts as a low-pass filter that induces destructive interference in high-frequency dimensions, effectively creating a \"blind spot\" for local positional information (e.g., slash patterns). To address this, we introduce Prism, a training-free spectral-aware approach that decomposes block selection into high-frequency and low-frequency branches. By applying energy-based temperature calibration, Prism restores the attenuated positional signals directly from pooled representations, enabling block importance estimation using purely block-level operations, thereby improving efficiency. Extensive evaluations confirm that Prism maintains accuracy parity with full attention while delivering up to $\\mathbf{5.1\\times}$ speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Prism\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347block-sparse attention\u4e2dblock\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u586b\u5145\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u4e2d\uff0cblock-sparse attention\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173block\u4f9d\u7136\u662f\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u4ed8\u51fa\u9ad8\u6602\u7684token\u7ea7\u4ee3\u4ef7\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u6790\u901a\u8fc7mean pooling\u4e0eRoPE\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u4f1a\u635f\u5931\u9ad8\u9891\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u7cbe\u786e\u7684block\u7b5b\u9009\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51faPrism\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u7528\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u652f\u5c06block\u5206\u4e3a\u9ad8\u9891\u548c\u4f4e\u9891\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u91cf\u6e29\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u8fd8\u539f\u88ab\u524a\u5f31\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ec5\u7528block\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b8c\u6210\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "Prism\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u901f\u6bd4\u53ef\u8fbe5.1\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Prism\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86mean pooling\u4e0b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684block\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684block-sparse attention\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u8d28\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5ca9\u77f3\u8282\u7406\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8282\u7406\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5ca9\u77f3\u8282\u7406\u8ffd\u8e2a\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u88c2\u9699\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u5730\u8d28\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5ca9\u77f3\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u573a\u666f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8282\u7406\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u76d2\u5f0f\u548c\u8fb9\u5761\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1aa\uff09\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1bb\uff09\u6807\u7b7e\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1bc\uff09\u5b8c\u5168\u96f6\u6837\u672c\uff08\u4ec5\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\uff1bd\uff09\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8282\u7406\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5177\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To provide flexibility, the function offloading framework is designed to incorporate different offloading decision making algorithms and quality of service~(QoS) requirements that can be adjusted to different scenarios or the objectives of the CAVs. With a focus on the applicability, we propose an efficient location-based approach, where the decision whether tasks are processed locally or remotely depends on the location of the CAV. We apply the proposed framework on the use case of service-oriented trajectory planning, where we offload the trajectory planning task of CAVs to a Multi-Access Edge Computing~(MEC) server. The evaluation is conducted in both simulation and real-world application.

It stands as a representative in a fundamental challenge to the intellectual foundations of AI, for it integrally synthesizes major issues in methodologies within LLMs and possesses an iconic a priori rationalist perspective. We examine this famous critic from both the perspective in pre-existing literature of linguistics and psychology as well as a research based on an experiment inquiring the capacity of learning both possible and impossible languages among LLMs. We constructed a set of syntactically impossible languages by applying certain transformations to English. These include reversing whole sentences, and adding negation based on word-count parity. Two rounds of controlled experiments were each conducted on GPT-2 small models and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Statistical analysis (Welch's t-test) shows GPT2 small models underperform in learning all of the impossible languages compared to their performance on the possible language (p<.001). On the other hand, LSTM models' performance tallies with Chomsky's argument, suggesting the irreplaceable role of the evolution of transformer architecture. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical findings, we propose a new vision within Chomsky's theory towards LLMs, and a shift of theoretical paradigm outside Chomsky, from his \"rationalist-romantics\" paradigm to functionalism and empiricism in LLMs research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u5e94\u4e86Chomsky\u5173\u4e8eCHATGPT\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u771f\u6b63\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\uff0c\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LLM\u5bf9\u201c\u53ef\u80fd\u201d\u4e0e\u201c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u201d\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Chomsky\u7b49\u5b66\u8005\u6279\u8bc4LLM\u53ea\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u822c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u5b9e\u9645\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u201c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u201d\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u68c0\u9a8c\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u8ba8AI\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u548c\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u5173\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4eba\u5de5\u201c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u8a00\u201d(\u5982\u53e5\u5b50\u5012\u5e8f\u3001\u6309\u5947\u5076\u8bcd\u6570\u52a0\u5426\u5b9a\u7b49)\u53ca\u6b63\u5e38\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u5bf9GPT-2\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u548cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u8f6e\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Welch's t-test\u8fdb\u884c\u7edf\u8ba1\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cGPT-2\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u660e\u663e\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u201c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u8a00\u201d\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdc\u900a\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5e38\u89c4\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8fbep<0.001\u3002\u800cLSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0eChomsky\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8bf4\u660eTransformer\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u8d77\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9Chomsky\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u8baeAI\u8bed\u8a00\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u529f\u80fd\u4e3b\u4e49\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u518d\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7406\u6027\u4e3b\u4e49\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u89c2\u3002"}}

One major goal of offloading a subset of functions in the processing chain of a CAV to remote devices is to reduce the overall computational complexity on the CAV. The extension of using remote services, however, requires careful safety analysis, since the remotely created data are corrupted more easily, e.g., through an attacker on the remote device or by intercepting the wireless transmission. To tackle this problem, we first analyze the concept of SOA for distributed environments. From this, we derive a safety framework that validates the reliability of remote services and the data received locally. Since it is possible for the autonomous driving task to offload multiple different services, we propose a specific multi-staged framework for safety analysis dependent on the service composition of local and remote services. For efficiency reasons, we directly include the multi-staged framework for safety analysis in our service-oriented function offloading framework (SOFOF) that we have proposed in earlier work.

However, existing work lacks a unified answer to three fundamental questions: (1) what defines high-quality reasoning, (2) how to reliably evaluate long, implicitly structured reasoning traces, and (3) how to use such evaluation signals for reasoning optimization. To address these challenges, we provide a unified perspective. (1) We introduce the ME$^2$ principle to characterize reasoning quality along macro- and micro-level concerning efficiency and effectiveness. (2) Built on this principle, we model reasoning traces as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and develop a DAG-based pairwise evaluation method, capturing complex reasoning structures.

The models are available at https://huggingface.co/collections/StevenHH2000/fine-r1", "summary": "Any entity in the visual world can be hierarchically grouped based on shared characteristics and mapped to fine-grained sub-categories. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on coarse-grained visual tasks, they often struggle with Fine-Grained Visual Recognition (FGVR). Adapting general-purpose MLLMs to FGVR typically requires large amounts of annotated data, which is costly to obtain, leaving a substantial performance gap compared to contrastive CLIP models dedicated for discriminative tasks. Moreover, MLLMs tend to overfit to seen sub-categories and generalize poorly to unseen ones. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-R1, an MLLM tailored for FGVR through an R1-style training framework: (1) Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-tuning, where we construct a high-quality FGVR CoT dataset with rationales of \"visual analysis, candidate sub-categories, comparison, and prediction\", transition the model into a strong open-world classifier; and (2) Triplet Augmented Policy Optimization, where Intra-class Augmentation mixes trajectories from anchor and positive images within the same category to improve robustness to intra-class variance, while Inter-class Augmentation maximizes the response distinction conditioned on images across sub-categories to enhance discriminative ability. With only 4-shot training, Fine-R1 outperforms existing general MLLMs, reasoning MLLMs, and even contrastive CLIP models in identifying both seen and unseen sub-categories, showing promise in working in knowledge-intensive domains where gathering expert annotations for all sub-categories is arduous.

In this case, the closed-loop system admits a homogeneous approximation of negative degree, and thus the control objective is achieved in finite-time.

Various benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate such agents. However, existing benchmarks often construct queries backward from answers, producing unnatural tasks misaligned with real-world needs. Moreover, these benchmarks tend to focus on either locating specific information or aggregating information from multiple sources, while relying on static answer sets prone to data contamination. To bridge these gaps, we introduce GISA, a benchmark for General Information-Seeking Assistants comprising 373 human-crafted queries that reflect authentic information-seeking scenarios. GISA features four structured answer formats (item, set, list, and table), enabling deterministic evaluation. It integrates both deep reasoning and broad information aggregation within unified tasks, and includes a live subset with periodically updated answers to resist memorization.

Although whole-slide images (WSIs) provide rich morphological information, prior computational pathology approaches typically address metastatic status or site prediction as isolated tasks, and do not explicitly model the clinically sequential decision process of metastatic risk assessment followed by downstream site-specific evaluation. To address this research gap, we present a decision-aware, concept-aligned MIL framework, HistoMet, for prognostic metastatic outcome prediction from primary tumor WSIs. Our proposed framework adopts a two-module prediction pipeline in which the likelihood of metastatic progression from the primary tumor is first estimated, followed by conditional prediction of metastatic site for high-risk cases. To guide representation learning and improve clinical interpretability, our framework integrates linguistically defined and data-adaptive metastatic concepts through a pretrained pathology vision-language model. We evaluate HistoMet on a multi-institutional pan-cancer cohort of 6504 patients with metastasis follow-up and site annotations. Under clinically relevant high-sensitivity screening settings (95 percent sensitivity), HistoMet significantly reduces downstream workload while maintaining high metastatic risk recall. Conditional on metastatic cases, HistoMet achieves a macro F1 of 74.6 with a standard deviation of 1.3 and a macro one-vs-rest AUC of 92.1. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling clinical decision structure enables robust and deployable prognostic prediction of metastatic progression and site tropism directly from primary tumor histopathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHistoMet\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u53d1\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff08WSIs\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u80bf\u7624\u662f\u5426\u53d1\u751f\u8f6c\u79fb\u53ca\u5176\u8f6c\u79fb\u90e8\u4f4d\u3002HistoMet\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u6027\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u764c\u75c7\u7c7b\u578b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u80bf\u7624\u8f6c\u79fb\u662f\u764c\u75c7\u81f4\u6b7b\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u4ece\u75c5\u7406\u5207\u7247\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u79fb\u53d1\u751f\u53ca\u5176\u8f6c\u79fb\u90e8\u4f4d\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u5904\u7406\u8f6c\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u90e8\u4f4d\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u826f\u597d\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MIL\uff09\u6846\u67b6HistoMet\u3002\u5176\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f30\u8ba1\u539f\u53d1\u80bf\u7624\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9ad8\u5371\u518d\u9884\u6d4b\u5177\u4f53\u8f6c\u79fb\u90e8\u4f4d\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5f15\u5165\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u57286504\u540d\u5e26\u6709\u8f6c\u79fb\u968f\u8bbf\u53ca\u90e8\u4f4d\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u591a\u764c\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cHistoMet\u572895%\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u540e\u7eed\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002\u5728\u5df2\u53d1\u751f\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u79fb\u90e8\u4f4d\u5b8f\u5e73\u5747F1\u8fbe\u523074.6\uff0c\u5b8f\u5e73\u5747AUC\u4e3a92.1\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u4f4e\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u6d41\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u8fdb\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f6c\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u90e8\u4f4d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u624e\u5b9e\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, these are rarely available for high-dimensional mechanical systems such as deformable objects or soft robots. While neural architectures can learn to approximate complex dynamics, they are either limited to low-dimensional systems or provide only limited formal control guarantees due to a lack of embedded physical structure. This paper introduces a latent control framework based on learned structure-preserving reduced-order dynamics for high-dimensional Lagrangian systems. We derive a reduced tracking law for fully actuated systems and adopt a Riemannian perspective on projection-based model-order reduction to study the resulting latent and projected closed-loop dynamics. By quantifying the sources of modeling error, we derive interpretable conditions for stability and convergence. We extend the proposed controller and analysis to underactuated systems by introducing learned actuation patterns.

A Mechanistic Analysis of Cell Location", "comment": null, "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for table-related tasks, the internal mechanisms enabling them to process linearized two-dimensional structured tables remain opaque. In this work, we investigate the process of table understanding by dissecting the atomic task of cell location. Through activation patching and complementary interpretability techniques, we delineate the table understanding mechanism into a sequential three-stage pipeline: Semantic Binding, Coordinate Localization, and Information Extraction. We demonstrate that models locate the target cell via an ordinal mechanism that counts discrete delimiters to resolve coordinates. Furthermore, column indices are encoded within a linear subspace that allows for precise steering of model focus through vector arithmetic. Finally, we reveal that models generalize to multi-cell location tasks by multiplexing the identical attention heads identified during atomic location.

However, despite excelling at general search, existing agents often struggle to bridge the cognitive gap between pixel-level perception and high-level marketing logic. To address this challenge, we introduce AD-MIR, a framework designed to decode advertising intent via a two-stage architecture. First, in the Structure-Aware Memory Construction phase, the system converts raw video into a structured database by integrating semantic retrieval with exact keyword matching. This approach prioritizes fine-grained brand details (e.g., logos, on-screen text) while dynamically filtering out irrelevant background noise to isolate key protagonists. Second, the Structured Reasoning Agent mimics a marketing expert through an iterative inquiry loop, decomposing the narrative to deduce implicit persuasion tactics. Crucially, it employs an evidence-based self-correction mechanism that rigorously validates these insights against specific video frames, automatically backtracking when visual support is lacking. Evaluation on the AdsQA benchmark demonstrates that AD-MIR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the strongest general-purpose agent, DVD, by 1.8% in strict and 9.5% in relaxed accuracy. These results underscore that effective advertising understanding demands explicitly grounding abstract marketing strategies in pixel-level evidence.

A critical component of this interaction is Interactive Visual Grounding (IVG), through which robots must interpret human intentions and resolve ambiguity. Existing IVG models generally lack a mechanism to determine when to ask clarification questions, as they implicitly rely on their learned representations. CLUE addresses this gap by converting the VLM's cross-modal attention into an explicit, spatially grounded signal for deciding when to ask. We extract text to image attention maps and pass them to a lightweight CNN to detect referential ambiguity, while a LoRA fine-tuned decoder conducts the dialog and emits grounding location tokens. We train on a real-world interactive dataset for IVG, and a mixed ambiguity set for the detector. With InViG-only supervision, our model surpasses a state-of-the-art method while using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Similarly, the ambiguity detector outperforms prior baselines.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in advancing the field of quality estimation of machine translation. However, most of the QE approaches solely rely on scalar quality scores, offering no explicit information about the translation errors that should drive these judgments. Moreover, for low-resource languages where annotated QE data is limited, existing approaches struggle to achieve reliable performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the first segment-level QE dataset for English to Malayalam, a severely resource-scarce language pair in the QE domain, comprising human-annotated Direct Assessment (DA) scores and Translation Quality Remarks (TQR), which are short, contextual, free-form annotator comments that describe translation errors. We further introduce ALOPE-RL, a policy-based reinforcement learning framework that trains efficient adapters based on policy rewards derived from DA score and TQR. Integrating error-aware rewards with ALOPE-RL, enables LLMs to reason about translation quality beyond numeric scores.

Our evaluation reveals a stark discrepancy between literature-reported benchmarks and real-world efficacy, particularly when transitioning from structural to functional domains. Such systemic failures underscore that current 3D foundation models are far from achieving truly general-purpose status, necessitating a paradigm shift toward multi-modal training and evaluation to bridge the gap between idealized benchmarking and comprehensive clinical utility.

Addressing this challenge calls for analyzing interactions between agents and incorporating common-sense reasoning into planning. This paper presents a social robot navigation framework that integrates geometric planning with contextual social reasoning. The system first extracts obstacles and human dynamics to generate geometrically feasible candidate paths, then leverages a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) to evaluate these paths, informed by contextually grounded social expectations, selecting a socially optimized path for the controller. This task-specific VLM distills social reasoning from large foundation models into a smaller and efficient model, allowing the framework to perform real-time adaptation in diverse human-robot interaction contexts. Experiments in four social navigation contexts demonstrate that our method achieves the best overall performance with the lowest personal space violation duration, the minimal pedestrian-facing time, and no social zone intrusions.

However, the prevailing autoregressive paradigm imposes strict serial constraints, limiting generation efficiency and introducing exposure bias. In this paper, we investigate Masked Diffusion Modeling~(MDM) as a non-autoregressive paradigm for speech LLMs and introduce VocalNet-MDM. To adapt MDM for streaming speech interaction, we address two critical challenges: training-inference mismatch and iterative overhead. We propose Hierarchical Block-wise Masking to align training objectives with the progressive masked states encountered during block diffusion decoding, and Iterative Self-Distillation to compress multi-step refinement into fewer steps for low-latency inference.

Existing approaches largely rely on human teleoperation with wearable devices or specialized sensing equipment to capture hand-object interactions, which limits scalability. In this work, we propose VIDEOMANIP, a device-free framework that learns dexterous manipulation directly from RGB human videos. Leveraging recent advances in computer vision, VIDEOMANIP reconstructs explicit 4D robot-object trajectories from monocular videos by estimating human hand poses, object meshes, and retargets the reconstructed human motions to robotic hands for manipulation learning. To make the reconstructed robot data suitable for dexterous manipulation training, we introduce hand-object contact optimization with interaction-centric grasp modeling, as well as a demonstration synthesis strategy that generates diverse training trajectories from a single video, enabling generalizable policy learning without additional robot demonstrations. In simulation, the learned grasping model achieves a 70.25% success rate across 20 diverse objects using the Inspire Hand. In the real world, manipulation policies trained from RGB videos achieve an average 62.86% success rate across seven tasks using the LEAP Hand, outperforming retargeting-based methods by 15.87%.

However, deploying these models in production can be inefficient when only a subset of the supported languages is of interest. There has been some research conducted on identifying whether machine translation models have language-specific or language-agnostic heads, however no research has been conducted for multilingual LLMs, to the best of our knowledge, that as we know are capable of performing diverse tasks beyond just translation. This paper explores whether multilingual LLMs have specialized language attention heads for each language, and investigates the possibility of removing language-specific heads for unwanted languages without degrading performance in the targeted languages. Our findings could inform more efficient deployment strategies for multilingual LLMs, enabling reduced model complexity while maintaining high accuracy for targeted languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4e13\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u8bed\u8a00\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5c1d\u8bd5\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u5934\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u53ea\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u90e8\u5206\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u591a\u8bed\u8a00LLMs\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u79cd\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u5934\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53bb\u9664\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5934\u540e\u5bf9\u6240\u9700\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u786e\u5b9e\u8d1f\u8d23\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u5934\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u7b80\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

This work evaluates the errors across the reconstruction pipeline and explores the use of voxel and surface-based accuracy metrics for different segmentation algorithms and geometry types. A sphere, a facemask, and an AAA were printed using the SLA technique and scanned using a micro-CT machine. Segmentation was performed using GMM, Otsu and RG based methods. Segmented and reference models aligned using the KU algorithm, were quantitatively compared to evaluate metrics like Dice and Jaccard scores, precision. Surface meshes were registered with reference meshes using an ICP-based alignment process. Metrics like chamfer distance, and average Hausdorff distance were evaluated. The Otsu method was found to be the most suitable method for all the geometries. AAA yielded low overlap scores due to its small wall thickness and misalignment. The effect of class imbalance on specificity was observed the most for AAA. Surface-based accuracy metrics differed from the voxel-based trends. The RG method performed best for sphere, while GMM and Otsu perform better for AAA. The facemask surface was most error-prone, possibly due to misalignment during the ICP process. Segmentation accuracy is a cumulative sum of errors across different stages of the reconstruction process. High voxel-based accuracy metrics may be misleading in cases of high class imbalance and sensitivity to alignment. The Jaccard index is found to be more stringent than the Dice and more suitable for accuracy assessment for thin-walled structures. Voxel and point cloud alignment should be ensured to make any reliable assessment of the reconstruction pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u5272\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7c7b\u578b\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u533b\u5b66\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6210\u50cf\u8bbe\u5907\u3001\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u7f51\u683c\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7b49\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5305\u62ec\u51e0\u4f55\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u4f53\u7d20\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u6253\u5370\u7403\u4f53\u3001\u4eba\u8138\u7f69\u548c\u8179\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u7624\uff08AAA\uff09\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u578bCT\u626b\u63cf\u3002\u91c7\u7528GMM\u3001Otsu\u53ca\u533a\u57df\u589e\u957f\uff08RG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u7528KU\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u51c6\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7Dice\u3001Jaccard\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u53caChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001Hausdorff\u5747\u503c\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u5339\u914d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "Otsu\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46AAA\u56e0\u58c1\u539a\u5c0f\u548c\u914d\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5bf9\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6307\u6807\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u51fa\u73b0\u5728AAA\u4e0a\u3002RG\u5bf9\u7403\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u6700\u597d\uff0cGMM\u3001Otsu\u5bf9AAA\u66f4\u4f73\u3002\u9ad8\u4f53\u7d20\u6307\u6807\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u6781\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u914d\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002Jaccard\u6307\u6570\u6bd4Dice\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8584\u58c1\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7531\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\u591a\u73af\u8282\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u9ad8\u4f53\u7d20\u6307\u6807\u672a\u5fc5\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8584\u58c1\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u6307\u6807\u3002\u52a1\u5fc5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f53\u7d20\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

A fundamental tension limits this approach: language is often too abstract to guide the concrete physical understanding required for robust manipulation. In this work, we introduce Contact-Anchored Policies (CAP), which replace language conditioning with points of physical contact in space. Simultaneously, we structure CAP as a library of modular utility models rather than a monolithic generalist policy. This factorization allows us to implement a real-to-sim iteration cycle: we build EgoGym, a lightweight simulation benchmark, to rapidly identify failure modes and refine our models and datasets prior to real-world deployment. We show that by conditioning on contact and iterating via simulation, CAP generalizes to novel environments and embodiments out of the box on three fundamental manipulation skills while using only 23 hours of demonstration data, and outperforms large, state-of-the-art VLAs in zero-shot evaluations by 56%.

Although improving Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has attracted significant research efforts, the extent to which the fundamental paradigms induce generalization has yet to be systematically explored. In this study, we shed light on how the interplay between these core paradigms influences LLMs' reasoning behavior. To this end, we first collect a new dataset of reasoning trajectories from symbolic tasks, each targeting one of the three fundamental paradigms, to abstract from concrete world knowledge. Then, we investigate effective ways for inducing these skills into LLMs. We experiment with a battery of methods including simple fine-tuning, and more complex approaches to increase model depth, or transform a dense model to a mixture-of-experts. We comprehensively evaluate induced models on realistic out-of-domain tasks, that are entirely formulated in natural language and contain real-world knowledge. Our results reveal that our approach yields strong generalizability with substantial performance gains (up to $14.60$) across realistic tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6f14\u7ece\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u548c\u6eaf\u56e0\u4e09\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f15\u8d77\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u4e09\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u6f14\u7ece\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u3001\u6eaf\u56e0\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u5c1a\u672a\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e09\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9LLM\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u6f14\u7ece\u3001\u5f52\u7eb3\u3001\u6eaf\u56e0\uff09\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u62bd\u8c61\u51fa\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u624b\u6bb5\u5411LLM\u6ce8\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u5c06\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe\u523014.60\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4e09\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u9886\u57df\u7684LLM\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

In this research, we propose an augmentation to this framework, making a case for the audio modality as an additional source of information to understand the driver, and in the evolving autonomy landscape, also the passengers and those outside the vehicle. We expand LILO by incorporating audio signals, forming the looking-and-listening inside-and-outside (L-LIO) framework to enhance driver state assessment and environment understanding through multimodal sensor fusion. We evaluate three example cases where audio enhances vehicle safety: supervised learning on driver speech audio to classify potential impairment states (e.g., intoxication), collection and analysis of passenger natural language instructions (e.g., \"turn after that red building\") to motivate how spoken language can interface with planning systems through audio-aligned instruction data, and limitations of vision-only systems where audio may disambiguate the guidance and gestures of external agents. Datasets include custom-collected in-vehicle and external audio samples in real-world environments. Pilot findings show that audio yields safety-relevant insights, particularly in nuanced or context-rich scenarios where sound is critical to safe decision-making or visual signals alone are insufficient. Challenges include ambient noise interference, privacy considerations, and robustness across human subjects, motivating further work on reliability in dynamic real-world contexts.

We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT policies, train compact ViT heads on frozen foundation-model (FM) features, and vary ID support in scale, diversity, and temporal context. (1) ViT policies are markedly more OOD-robust than comparably sized CNN/FC, and FM features yield state-of-the-art success at a latency cost. (2) Naive temporal inputs (multi-frame) do not beat the best single-frame baseline. (3) The largest single factor drops are rural $\\rightarrow$ urban and day $\\rightarrow$ night ($\\sim 31\\%$ each); actor swaps $\\sim 10\\%$, moderate rain $\\sim 7\\%$; season shifts can be drastic, and combining a time flip with other changes further degrades performance. (4) FM-feature policies stay above $85\\%$ under three simultaneous changes; non-FM single-frame policies take a large first-shift hit, and all no-FM models fall below $50\\%$ by three changes. (5) Interactions are non-additive: some pairings partially offset, whereas season-time combinations are especially harmful. (6) Training on winter/snow is most robust to single-factor shifts, while a rural+summer baseline gives the best overall OOD performance.

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u7528\u4f8b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740VLMs\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u5176\u7cfb\u7edf\u96c6\u6210\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u7b5b\u67e5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06VLM\u5d4c\u5165\u7528\u4e8eWaymo\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3\uff09\u5728doScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u7ea6\u675f\u89c4\u5212\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "1\uff09VLM\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u522b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u98ce\u9669\u6709\u826f\u597d\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06VLM\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u66f4\u7d27\u5bc6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b3\uff09\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u4e25\u91cd\u5931\u8bef\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u7cca\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6781\u5177\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u4f46\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5bf9\u63a5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\u3002"}}

However, we identify that the primary bottleneck to real-world robustness is not resource scale alone, but the distributional shift among the human demonstration distribution, the inductive bias learned by the policy, and the test-time execution distribution -- a systematic inconsistency that causes compounding errors in multi-stage tasks. To mitigate these inconsistencies, we propose $\u03c7_{0}$, a resource-efficient framework with effective modules designated to achieve production-level robustness in robotic manipulation. Our approach builds off three technical pillars: (i) Model Arithmetic, a weight-space merging strategy that efficiently soaks up diverse distributions of different demonstrations, varying from object appearance to state variations; (ii) Stage Advantage, a stage-aware advantage estimator that provides stable, dense progress signals, overcoming the numerical instability of prior non-stage approaches; and (iii) Train-Deploy Alignment, which bridges the distribution gap via spatio-temporal augmentation, heuristic DAgger corrections, and temporal chunk-wise smoothing. $\u03c7_{0}$ enables two sets of dual-arm robots to collaboratively orchestrate long-horizon garment manipulation, spanning tasks from flattening, folding, to hanging different clothes. Our method exhibits high-reliability autonomy; we are able to run the system from arbitrary initial state for consecutive 24 hours non-stop. Experiments validate that $\u03c7_{0}$ surpasses the state-of-the-art $\u03c0_{0.5}$ in success rate by nearly 250%, with only 20-hour data and 8 A100 GPUs.

PoT interleaves (i) temporal evidence selection, (ii) step-wise state updates, and (iii) constrained answer synthesis, enabling the model to progressively refine hypotheses while maintaining traceability to video evidence. The framework is designed to be model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing vision-language backbones, supporting both closed-book reasoning and evidence-augmented reasoning with external tools. We further introduce a unified representation for PoT traces that aligns intermediate decisions with temporal segments, which improves robustness to distractors and reduces hallucinated explanations.

While online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving general foundation models, applying RL to VLA manipulation in real-world settings is still hindered by low exploration efficiency and a restricted exploration space. Through systematic real-world experiments, we observe that the effective exploration space of online RL is closely tied to the data distribution of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose TwinRL, a digital twin-real-world collaborative RL framework designed to scale and guide exploration for VLA models. First, a high-fidelity digital twin is efficiently reconstructed from smartphone-captured scenes, enabling realistic bidirectional transfer between real and simulated environments. During the SFT warm-up stage, we introduce an exploration space expansion strategy using digital twins to broaden the support of the data trajectory distribution. Building on this enhanced initialization, we propose a sim-to-real guided exploration strategy to further accelerate online RL. Specifically, TwinRL performs efficient and parallel online RL in the digital twin prior to deployment, effectively bridging the gap between offline and online training stages. Subsequently, we exploit efficient digital twin sampling to identify failure-prone yet informative configurations, which are used to guide targeted human-in-the-loop rollouts on the real robot. In our experiments, TwinRL approaches 100% success in both in-distribution regions covered by real-world demonstrations and out-of-distribution regions, delivering at least a 30% speedup over prior real-world RL methods and requiring only about 20 minutes on average across four tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TwinRL\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684RL\u56e0\u63a2\u7d22\u4f4e\u6548\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u53c8\u80fd\u62d3\u5c55\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTwinRL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u624b\u673a\u5feb\u901f\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5207\u6362\u3002\u5728SFT\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6269\u5c55\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u5b9e\u534f\u540c\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4f53\u4e0a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e76\u884cRL\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u5931\u8d25\u4f46\u6709\u542f\u53d1\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u518d\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "result": "TwinRL\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea6100%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4e0d\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u5df2\u8986\u76d6\u8fd8\u662f\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u533a\u57df\u3002\u6574\u4f53RL\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c1130%\uff0c\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea620\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TwinRL\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u534f\u540c\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This task is particularly challenging due to the highly unstructured environment: coal and gangue are randomly piled, backgrounds are complex and variable, and foreign objects often exhibit low contrast, deformation, occlusion, resulting in coupling with their surroundings. These characteristics weaken the stability and regularity assumptions that many anomaly detection methods rely on in structured industrial settings, leading to notable performance degradation. To support evaluation and comparison in this setting, we construct \\textbf{CoalAD}, a benchmark for unsupervised foreign-object anomaly detection with pixel-level localization in coal-stream scenes. We further propose a complementary-cue collaborative perception framework that extracts and fuses complementary anomaly evidence from three perspectives: object-level semantic composition modeling, semantic-attribution-based global deviation analysis, and fine-grained texture matching.

A Study on the Effect of Images on Clarifying Questions in Conversational Search", "comment": "Accepted at CHIIR 2025", "summary": "Conversational search systems increasingly employ clarifying questions to refine user queries and improve the search experience. Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of text-based clarifying questions in enhancing both retrieval performance and user experience. While images have been shown to improve retrieval performance in various contexts, their impact on user performance when incorporated into clarifying questions remains largely unexplored. We conduct a user study with 73 participants to investigate the role of images in conversational search, specifically examining their effects on two search-related tasks: (i) answering clarifying questions and (ii) query reformulation. We compare the effect of multimodal and text-only clarifying questions in both tasks within a conversational search context from various perspectives. Our findings reveal that while participants showed a strong preference for multimodal questions when answering clarifying questions, preferences were more balanced in the query reformulation task. The impact of images varied with both task type and user expertise. In answering clarifying questions, images helped maintain engagement across different expertise levels, while in query reformulation they led to more precise queries and improved retrieval performance. Interestingly, for clarifying question answering, text-only setups demonstrated better user performance as they provided more comprehensive textual information in the absence of images. These results provide valuable insights for designing effective multimodal conversational search systems, highlighting that the benefits of visual augmentation are task-dependent and should be strategically implemented based on the specific search context and user characteristics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5165\u6f84\u6e05\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u56fe\u7247\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4f5c\u7528\u968f\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u7528\u6587\u5b57\u6f84\u6e05\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u6f84\u6e05\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4f5c\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u4e86\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u5b8c\u6210\u641c\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d89\u53ca73\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u6587\u672c+\u56fe\u7247\uff09\u548c\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6f84\u6e05\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6f84\u6e05\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4f5c\u7b54\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u591a\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4f5c\u7b54\u6f84\u6e05\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u66f4\u504f\u597d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5219\u504f\u597d\u5e76\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u56fe\u7247\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\u7528\u6237\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u6784\u65f6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4ec5\u6587\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5728\u6f84\u6e05\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4f5c\u7b54\u4e0a\u7684\u7528\u6237\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f1a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u3002"}}

We propose U-KABS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates the expressive power of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture to enhance segmentation performance. The U-KABS model combines the convolutional and squeeze-and-excitation stage, which enhances channel-wise feature representations, and the KAN Bernstein Spline (KABS) stage, which employs learnable activation functions based on Bernstein polynomials and B-splines. This hybrid design leverages the global smoothness of Bernstein polynomials and the local adaptability of B-splines, enabling the model to effectively capture both broad contextual trends and fine-grained patterns critical for delineating complex structures in medical images. Skip connections between encoder and decoder layers support effective multi-scale feature fusion and preserve spatial details.

Traditional methods, which leverage automated metrics to compare machine-generated summaries from a collection of opinion pieces, e.g. product reviews, have shown limitations due to the paradigm shift introduced by large language models (LLM). This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a novel, fully automated methodology for assessing the factual consistency of such summaries. The method is based on measuring the similarity between the claims in a given summary with those from the original reviews, measuring the coverage and consistency of the generated summary. To do so, we rely on a simple approach to extract factual assessment from texts that we then compare and summarize in a suitable score. We demonstrate that the proposed metric attributes higher scores to similar claims, regardless of whether the claim is negated, paraphrased, or expanded, and that the score has a high correlation to human judgment when compared to state-of-the-art metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6027AI\u6240\u751f\u6210\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u7c7b\u6458\u8981\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u5224\u65ad\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u52a8\u4e0b\u5df2\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u6027AI\u7684\u6458\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u610f\u89c1\u578b\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5148\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u53ca\u539f\u59cb\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u5bf9\u4e24\u8005\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6458\u8981\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u5f97\u5206\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u3001\u91ca\u4e49\u6216\u6269\u5c55\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6bd4\u5bf9\u4e3b\u5f20\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u5bf9\u542b\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u4e3b\u5f20\u8d4b\u4e88\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u5728\u610f\u89c1\u7c7b\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Conventional approaches predominantly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which incur high energy costs due to extensive analog-to-digital conversions and large-scale image computations required for low-latency, real-time responses. Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have shown promising advantages over conventional DNNs on digital or optoelectronic computing platforms in energy efficiency. By performing all-optical image processing via light diffraction at the speed of light, DONNs save computation energy costs while reducing the overhead associated with analog-to-digital conversions by all-optical encoding and computing. In this work, we propose a novel all-optical computing framework for RGB image segmentation and lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DONN system for image segmentation on the CityScapes dataset.

Yet this characteristic has not been carefully examined in the LLM research community and remains absent from most alignment studies. Debate-oriented sources provide a natural entry point for pluralism research. Previous work builds on online debate sources but remains constrained by costly human validation. Other debate-rich platforms such as Reddit and Kialo also offer promising material: Reddit provides linguistic diversity and scale but lacks clear argumentative structure, while Kialo supplies explicit pro/con graphs but remains overly concise and detached from natural discourse. We introduce PERSPECTRA, a pluralist benchmark that integrates the structural clarity of Kialo debate graphs with the linguistic diversity of real Reddit discussions. Using a controlled retrieval-and-expansion pipeline, we construct 3,810 enriched arguments spanning 762 pro/con stances on 100 controversial topics. Each opinion is expanded to multiple naturalistic variants, enabling robust evaluation of pluralism. We initialise three tasks with PERSPECTRA: opinion counting (identifying distinct viewpoints), opinion matching (aligning supporting stances and discourse to source opinions), and polarity check (inferring aggregate stance in mixed discourse). Experiments with state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary LLMs, highlight systematic failures, such as overestimating the number of viewpoints and misclassifying concessive structures, underscoring the difficulty of pluralism-aware understanding and reasoning.

Project page: https://rolling-sink.github.io/", "summary": "Recently, autoregressive (AR) video diffusion models has achieved remarkable performance. However, due to their limited training durations, a train-test gap emerges when testing at longer horizons, leading to rapid visual degradations. Following Self Forcing, which studies the train-test gap within the training duration, this work studies the train-test gap beyond the training duration, i.e., the gap between the limited horizons during training and open-ended horizons during testing. Since open-ended testing can extend beyond any finite training window, and long-video training is computationally expensive, we pursue a training-free solution to bridge this gap. To explore a training-free solution, we conduct a systematic analysis of AR cache maintenance. These insights lead to Rolling Sink. Built on Self Forcing (trained on only 5s clips), Rolling Sink effectively scales the AR video synthesis to ultra-long durations (e.g., 5-30 minutes at 16 FPS) at test time, with consistent subjects, stable colors, coherent structures, and smooth motions. As demonstrated by extensive experiments, Rolling Sink achieves superior long-horizon visual fidelity and temporal consistency compared to SOTA baselines.

Existing prediction methods using occupancy grid maps primarily focus on agent-agnostic scene predictions, while agent-specific predictions provide specialized behavior insights with the help of semantic information. However, both paradigms face distinct limitations: agent-agnostic models struggle to capture the behavioral complexities of dynamic actors, whereas agent-specific approaches fail to generalize to poorly perceived or unrecognized agents; combining both enables robust and safer motion forecasting. To address this, we propose a unified framework by leveraging Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps within a streamlined temporal decoding pipeline to simultaneously predict future occupancy state grids, vehicle grids, and scene flow grids. Relying on a lightweight spatiotemporal backbone, our approach is centered on a tailored, interdependent loss function that captures inter-grid dependencies and enables diverse future predictions. By using occupancy state information to enforce flow-guided transitions, the loss function acts as a regularizer that directs occupancy evolution while accounting for obstacles and occlusions. Consequently, the model not only predicts the specific behaviors of vehicle agents, but also identifies other dynamic entities and anticipates their evolution within the complex scene. Evaluations on real-world nuScenes and Woven Planet datasets demonstrate superior prediction performances for dynamic vehicles and generic dynamic scene elements compared to baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u7c7b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5360\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\u7684\u6574\u4f53\uff08agent-agnostic\uff09\u573a\u666f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\uff08agent-specific\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5404\u6709\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u523b\u753b\u52a8\u6001\u4f53\u7684\u590d\u6742\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u6e05\u6216\u672a\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u4f53\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\uff08Dynamic Occupancy Grid Maps, DOGMs\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u7a7a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u5360\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u683c\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u573a\u666f\u6d41\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7f51\u683c\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u5360\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea6\u675f\u6d41\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u969c\u788d\u7269\u4e0e\u906e\u6321\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u548cWoven Planet\u4e24\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u8f66\u8f86\u4e0e\u4e00\u822c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u878d\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u7f51\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5404\u7c7b\u52a8\u6001\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u672a\u6765\u72b6\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing vision-based occupancy forecasting methods focus on motion-related categories such as static and dynamic objects, while semantic information remains largely absent. Recent semantic occupancy forecasting approaches address this gap but rely on past occupancy predictions obtained from separate networks. This makes current methods sensitive to error accumulation and prevents learning spatio-temporal features directly from images. In this work, we present ForecastOcc, the first framework for vision-based semantic occupancy forecasting that jointly predicts future occupancy states and semantic categories. Our framework yields semantic occupancy forecasts for multiple horizons directly from past camera images, without relying on externally estimated maps. We evaluate ForecastOcc in two complementary settings: multi-view forecasting on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and monocular forecasting on SemanticKITTI, where we establish the first benchmark for this task. We introduce the first baselines by adapting two 2D forecasting modules within our framework. Importantly, we propose a novel architecture that incorporates a temporal cross-attention forecasting module, a 2D-to-3D view transformer, a 3D encoder for occupancy prediction, and a semantic occupancy head for voxel-level forecasts across multiple horizons. Extensive experiments on both datasets show that ForecastOcc consistently outperforms baselines, yielding semantically rich, future-aware predictions that capture scene dynamics and semantics critical for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faForecastOcc\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u80fd\u4ece\u76f8\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u73af\u5883\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u65f6\u523b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5982\u9759\u6001/\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u6700\u65b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5f25\u8865\u8be5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u7f51\u7edc\u5f97\u6765\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u56e0\u800c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faForecastOcc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5360\u636e\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u5730\u56fe\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u30012D\u8f6c3D\u89c6\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u30013D\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u5934\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u65f6\u523b\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5728Occ3D-nuScenes\u548cSemanticKITTI\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5355\u76ee\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728Occ3D-nuScenes\u548cSemanticKITTI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cForecastOcc\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u914d\u76842D\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u517c\u5177\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\u7684\u591a\u65f6\u523b\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u51fa\u573a\u666f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "ForecastOcc\u80fd\u591f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u591a\u65f6\u523b\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u7b49\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, complex multi-turn support remains challenging.This is because existing alignment schemes rely on sparse outcome-level signals, thus offering limited supervision for intermediate strategy decisions. To fill this gap, this paper proposes affective flow language model for emotional support conversation (AFlow), a framework that introduces fine-grained supervision on dialogue prefixes by modeling a continuous affective flow along multi-turn trajectories. AFlow can estimate intermediate utility over searched trajectories and learn preference-consistent strategy transitions. To improve strategy coherence and empathetic response quality, a subpath-level flow-balance objective is presented to propagate preference signals to intermediate states. Experiment results show consistent and significant improvements over competitive baselines in diverse emotional contexts. Remarkably, AFlow with a compact open-source backbone outperforms proprietary LMMs such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5 on major ESC metrics.

To address this, recent agentic thinking-with-videos paradigms have emerged, adopting a localize-clip-answer pipeline in which the model actively identifies relevant video segments, performs dense sampling within those clips, and then produces answers. However, existing methods remain inefficient, suffer from weak localization, and adhere to rigid workflows. To solve these issues, we propose VideoTemp-o3, a unified agentic thinking-with-videos framework that jointly models video grounding and question answering. VideoTemp-o3 exhibits strong localization capability, supports on-demand clipping, and can refine inaccurate localizations. Specifically, in the supervised fine-tuning stage, we design a unified masking mechanism that encourages exploration while preventing noise. For reinforcement learning, we introduce dedicated rewards to mitigate reward hacking. Besides, from the data perspective, we develop an effective pipeline to construct high-quality long video grounded QA data, along with a corresponding benchmark for systematic evaluation across various video durations.

For instance, when estimating the poses and shapes of objects in the scene and importing the resulting estimates into a simulator, small errors might translate to implausible configurations including object interpenetration or unstable equilibrium. This makes it difficult to predict the dynamic behavior of the scene using a digital twin, an important step in simulation-based planning and control of contact-rich behaviors. In this paper, we posit that object pose and shape estimation requires reasoning holistically over the scene (instead of reasoning about each object in isolation), accounting for object interactions and physical plausibility. Towards this goal, our first contribution is Picasso, a physics-constrained reconstruction pipeline that builds multi-object scene reconstructions by considering geometry, non-penetration, and physics. Picasso relies on a fast rejection sampling method that reasons over multi-object interactions, leveraging an inferred object contact graph to guide samples. Second, we propose the Picasso dataset, a collection of 10 contact-rich real-world scenes with ground truth annotations, as well as a metric to quantify physical plausibility, which we open-source as part of our benchmark. Finally, we provide an extensive evaluation of Picasso on our newly introduced dataset and on the YCB-V dataset, and show it largely outperforms the state of the art while providing reconstructions that are both physically plausible and more aligned with human intuition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPicasso\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f34\u968f\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\uff0c\u5982\u7269\u4f53\u7a7f\u900f\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Picasso\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u975e\u7a7f\u900f\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ba1\u7ebf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u65ad\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u63a5\u89e6\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u53e6\u5916\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Picasso\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b10\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5747\u5f00\u653e\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "Picasso\u5728\u81ea\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cYCB-V\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u548c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8fdc\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ea\u8003\u8651\u5355\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6574\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002Picasso\u6d41\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u63a8\u7406\u7269\u4f53\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4eff\u771f\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

With the widespread deployment of LLMs, in-the-wild interactions have emerged as a rich source of implicit reward signals. This raises the question: Can we develop reward models directly from in-the-wild interactions? In this work, we explore this possibility by adopting WildChat as an interaction source and proposing a pipeline to extract reliable human feedback, yielding 186k high-quality instances for training WildReward via ordinal regression directly on user feedback without preference pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WildReward achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to conventional reward models, with improved calibration and cross-sample consistency. We also observe that WildReward benefits directly from user diversity, where more users yield stronger reward models. Finally, we apply WildReward to online DPO training and observe significant improvements across various tasks.

While numerous deepfake detection methods have been proposed, existing benchmarks predominantly evaluate fine-tuned models, leaving a critical gap in understanding out-of-the-box performance -- the most common deployment scenario for practitioners. We present the first comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of 16 state-of-the-art detection methods, comprising 23 pretrained detector variants (due to multiple released versions of certain detectors), across 12 diverse datasets, comprising 2.6~million image samples spanning 291 unique generators including modern diffusion models. Our systematic analysis reveals striking findings: (1)~no universal winner exists, with detector rankings exhibiting substantial instability (Spearman~$\u03c1$: 0.01 -- 0.87 across dataset pairs); (2)~a 37~percentage-point performance gap separates the best detector (75.0\\% mean accuracy) from the worst (37.5\\%); (3)~training data alignment critically impacts generalization, causing up to 20--60\\% performance variance within architecturally identical detector families; (4)~modern commercial generators (Flux~Dev, Firefly~v4, Midjourney~v7) defeat most detectors, achieving only 18--30\\% average accuracy; and (5)~we identify three systematic failure patterns affecting cross-dataset generalization.

In this work, we present a 3D vehicle-conditioned pedestrian pose forecasting framework that explicitly incorporates surrounding vehicle information. To support this, we enhance the Waymo-3DSkelMo dataset with aligned 3D vehicle bounding boxes, enabling realistic modeling of multi-agent pedestrian-vehicle interactions. We introduce a sampling scheme to categorize scenes by pedestrian and vehicle count, facilitating training across varying interaction complexities. Our proposed network adapts the TBIFormer architecture with a dedicated vehicle encoder and pedestrian-vehicle interaction cross-attention module to fuse pedestrian and vehicle features, allowing predictions to be conditioned on both historical pedestrian motion and surrounding vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in forecasting accuracy and validate different approaches for modeling pedestrian-vehicle interactions, highlighting the importance of vehicle-aware 3D pose prediction for autonomous driving.

However, prior work is primarily evaluated on natural-language benchmarks using task-level metrics, where token-level difficulty is unobservable and confounded with architectural factors, making it unclear whether compute allocation truly aligns with underlying complexity. We address this gap through three contributions. First, we introduce a complexity-controlled evaluation paradigm using algorithmic and synthetic language tasks with parameterized difficulty, enabling direct testing of token-level compute allocation. Second, we propose ANIRA, a unified recurrent Transformer framework that supports per-token variable-depth computation while isolating compute allocation decisions from other model factors. Third, we use this framework to conduct a systematic analysis of token-level adaptive computation across alignment with complexity, generalization, and decision timing. Our results show that compute allocation aligned with task complexity can emerge without explicit difficulty supervision, but such alignment does not imply algorithmic generalization: models fail to extrapolate to unseen input sizes despite allocating additional computation. We further find that early compute decisions rely on static structural cues, whereas online halting more closely tracks algorithmic execution state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9token-level\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dtoken-level\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89c2\u6d4btoken\u7ea7\u96be\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u7d20\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5224\u65ad\u7b97\u529b\u5206\u914d\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u53cd\u6620\u5e95\u5c42\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u8bd5token\u7ea7\u7b97\u529b\u5206\u914d\uff1b\u63d0\u51faANIRA\u6a21\u578b\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u53ef\u53d8\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u529b\u5206\u914d\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u53ca\u51b3\u7b56\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u529b\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u96be\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u7b97\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5927\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u4ecd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\uff1b\u65e9\u671f\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u9760\u9759\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u7ebf\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6267\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u66f4\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136token\u7ea7\u7b97\u529b\u5206\u914d\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u80fd\u90e8\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u5e95\u5c42\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7b97\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u529b\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

Only MiVOLO, which uniquely combines face and body features via Vision Transformers, competes with VLMs. We further analyze age verification at the 18-year threshold, revealing that non-LLM models exhibit 60--100\\% false adult rates on minors while VLMs achieve 13--25\\%, and demonstrate that coarse age binning (8--9 classes) consistently degrades MAE beyond 13 years. Our stratified analysis across 14 age groups reveals that all models struggle most at extreme ages ($<$5 and 65+). These findings challenge the assumption that task-specific architectures are necessary for age estimation and suggest that the field should redirect toward distilling VLM capabilities into efficient specialized models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8634\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5305\u62ec22\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u67b6\u6784\u548c12\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bVLMs\uff09\u57288\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u4eba\u8138\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u4eba\u8138\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6b64\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u73b0\u4ee3VLMs\u4e0e\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6536\u96c6\u4e8622\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u516c\u5f00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u548c12\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41VLMs\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b83\u4eec\u57288\u4e2a\u4eba\u8138\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5e74\u9f84\u6bb5\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLM\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff095.65\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b9.88\u3002\u5176\u4e2dGemini 3 Flash Preview\uff08MAE 4.32\uff09\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684SOTA\uff08MiVOLO\uff0cMAE 5.10\uff09\u3002MiVOLO\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u80fd\u548cVLM\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7684\u975eLLM\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u572818\u5c81\u5206\u754c\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cVLM\u8bef\u5224\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7c97\u5206\u5e74\u9f84\u533a\u95f4\u4f1a\u8ba9MAE\u5927\u5e45\u6076\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e13\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f73\u4f46\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eVLM\u5728\u65e0\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u4ea6\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u591a\u6570\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u6765\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8VLM\u80fd\u529b\u84b8\u998f\u81f3\u9ad8\u6548\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Current evaluation of embodied world models has largely focused on perceptual fidelity (e.g., video generation quality), overlooking the functional utility of these models in downstream decision-making tasks. In this work, we introduce WorldArena, a unified benchmark designed to systematically evaluate embodied world models across both perceptual and functional dimensions. WorldArena assesses models through three dimensions: video perception quality, measured with 16 metrics across six sub-dimensions; embodied task functionality, which evaluates world models as data engines, policy evaluators, and action planners integrating with subjective human evaluation. Furthermore, we propose EWMScore, a holistic metric integrating multi-dimensional performance into a single interpretable index. Through extensive experiments on 14 representative models, we reveal a significant perception-functionality gap, showing that high visual quality does not necessarily translate into strong embodied task capability.

Yet, automated systems that extract locations from text often reproduce existing geographic and socioeconomic biases, leading to uneven visibility of crisis-affected regions. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these geographic disparities in extracting location information from humanitarian documents. We introduce a two-step framework that combines few-shot LLM-based named entity recognition with an agent-based geocoding module that leverages context to resolve ambiguous toponyms. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art pretrained and rule-based systems using both accuracy and fairness metrics across geographic and socioeconomic dimensions. Our evaluation uses an extended version of the HumSet dataset with refined literal toponym annotations. Results show that LLM-based methods substantially improve both the precision and fairness of geolocation extraction from humanitarian texts, particularly for underrepresented regions.

Most diffusion-based reconstructions are formulated around Gaussian-noise corruption and rely on additional consistency steps to incorporate SMS physics, which can be mismatched to the operator-governed degradations in SMS acquisition. We propose an operator-guided framework that models the degradation trajectory using known acquisition operators and inverts this process via deterministic updates. Within this framework, we introduce an operator-conditional dual-stream interaction network (OCDI-Net) that explicitly disentangles target-slice content from inter-slice interference and predicts structured degradations for operator-aligned inversion, and we instantiate reconstruction as a two-stage chained inference procedure that performs SMS slice separation followed by in-plane completion. Experiments on fastMRI brain data and prospectively acquired in vivo diffusion MRI data demonstrate improved fidelity and reduced slice leakage over conventional and learning-based SMS reconstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u91c7\u96c6\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff08OCDI-Net\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SMS MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u539f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9632\u6b62\u5207\u7247\u4e32\u6270\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dSMS MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u9ad8\u52a0\u901f\u6210\u50cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5207\u7247\u5e72\u6270\u548ck-space\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u51c6\u5bf9\u5e94\u91c7\u96c6\u7269\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u91c7\u96c6\u7269\u7406\u7b97\u5b50\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5373\u201coperator-guided\u201d\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bf9\u6210\u50cf\u9000\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u64cd\u4f5c\u9006\u8f6c\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86OCDI-Net\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a\u53cc\u6d41\u4ea4\u4e92\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5206\u79bb\u76ee\u6807\u5207\u7247\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9000\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u6b65\u5b8c\u6210\uff1a\u5148\u5207\u7247\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u518d\u56fe\u50cf\u590d\u539f\u8865\u5168\u3002", "result": "\u5728fastMRI\u8111\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u9645\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u5f25\u6563\u52a0\u6743MRI\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOCDI-Net\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60SMS\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5207\u7247\u4e32\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5\u91c7\u96c6\u7269\u7406\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\uff08OCDI-Net\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3SMS MRI\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u52a0\u901fMRI\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u79d1\u7814\u6210\u50cf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

A hypothesis is that stronger reasoning capability should improve safety by helping models recognize harmful intent even when it is not stated explicitly. We test this hypothesis in long-context settings where harmful intent is implicit and must be inferred through reasoning, and find that it does not hold. We introduce compositional reasoning attacks, a new threat model in which a harmful query is decomposed into incomplete fragments that scattered throughout a long context. The model is then prompted with a neutral reasoning query that induces retrieval and synthesis, causing the harmful intent to emerge only after composition. Evaluating 14 frontier LLMs on contexts up to 64k tokens, we uncover three findings: (1) models with stronger general reasoning capability are not more robust to compositional reasoning attacks, often assembling the intent yet failing to refuse; (2) safety alignment consistently degrades as context length increases; and (3) inference-time reasoning effort is a key mitigating factor: increasing inference-time compute reduces attack success by over 50 percentage points on GPT-oss-120b model. Together, these results suggest that safety does not automatically scale with reasoning capability, especially under long-context inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u9700\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u8bc6\u522b\u9690\u542b\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e5f\u4f1a\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5373\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8d28\u7591\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u628a\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u62c6\u6210\u96f6\u6563\u7247\u6bb5\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u4e2d\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u62fc\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6d4b\u8bd514\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u957f\u81f364k token\uff09\u5728\u6b64\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u70b9\uff1a1) \u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u4e0d\u66f4\u80fd\u963b\u6321\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u80fd\u62fc\u51fa\u6709\u5bb3\u610f\u56fe\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u62d2\u7b54\uff1b2) \u968f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u957f\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b3) \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5982GPT-oss-120b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u964d\u8d8550\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0d\u4f1a\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u81ea\u7136\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u9636\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u957f\u6587\u672c\u65b0\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u53e6\u5bfb\u5bf9\u7b56\u3002"}}

However, each paradigm suffers from inherent limitations when operating in isolation: OVAD is restricted to coarse category-level semantics, while RSVG is structurally limited to single-target localization. These limitations prevent existing methods from simultaneously supporting rich semantic understanding and multi-target detection. To address this, we propose OTA-Det, the first unified framework that bridges both paradigms into a cohesive architecture. Specifically, we introduce a task reformulation strategy that unifies task objectives and supervision mechanisms, enabling joint training across datasets from both paradigms with dense supervision signals. Furthermore, we propose a dense semantic alignment strategy that establishes explicit correspondence at multiple granularities, from holistic expressions to individual attributes, enabling fine-grained semantic understanding. To ensure real-time efficiency, OTA-Det builds upon the RT-DETR architecture, extending it from closed-set detection to open-text detection by introducing several high efficient modules, achieving state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks spanning both OVAD and RSVG tasks while maintaining real-time inference at 34 FPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OTA-Det\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u5411\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9065\u611f\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5404\u81ea\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08OVAD\uff09\u53ea\u652f\u6301\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u5411\uff08RSVG\uff09\u53c8\u53ea\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5355\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u4e24\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OTA-Det\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e24\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u505a\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u8ff0\u91cd\u6574\uff0c\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6307\u5411\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e24\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5bc6\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6574\u4f53\u5230\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u9762\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eRT-DETR\u7ed3\u6784\u6269\u5c55\u65b0\u9896\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u6587\u672c\u7c7b\u522b\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "OTA-Det\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u5411\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe34\u5e27\u6bcf\u79d2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "OTA-Det\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86OVAD\u4e0eRSVG\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5404\u81ea\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Prior work has mainly focused on perceptual hallucinations, leaving reasoning level unfaithfulness underexplored. To isolate faithfulness from linguistic priors, we introduce SPD-Faith Bench, a diagnostic benchmark based on fine-grained image difference reasoning that enforces explicit visual comparison. Evaluations on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal two systematic failure modes, perceptual blindness and perception-reasoning dissociation. We trace these failures to decaying visual attention and representation shifts in the residual stream. Guided by this analysis, we propose SAGE, a train-free visual evidence-calibrated framework that improves visual routing and aligns reasoning with perception. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly evaluating faithfulness beyond response correctness.

In particular, it arises from a persistent framing of LID as decontextualized text classification, which obscures the central role of prior probability estimation and is reinforced by institutional incentives that favor global, fixed-prior models.

It can be seamlessly integrated with image-based face swapping approaches built on diffusion models. First, we introduce a Frequency Spectrum Attention Interpolation technique to facilitate generation and intact key identity characteristics. Second, we achieve Target Structure Guidance via plug-and-play attention injection to better align the structural features from the target frame to the generation. Third, we present a Flow-Guided Attention Temporal Smoothening mechanism that enforces spatiotemporal coherence without modifying the underlying diffusion model to reduce temporal inconsistencies typically encountered in frame-wise generation.

It leverages both NCP and NTP to drive parameter updates and generates a concept to guide the generation of the following tokens. We train ConceptLM from scratch at scales ranging from 70M to 1.5B parameters with up to 300B training data, including Pythia and GPT-2 backbones. Results on 13 benchmarks show that NCP yields consistent performance gains over traditional token-level models.

Despite rapid advances, current systems lack spatial persistence: they fail to maintain stable scene structures over long trajectories, frequently hallucinating details when cameras revisit previously observed locations. We identify that this geometric drift stems from reliance on screen-space positional embeddings, which conflict with the projective geometry required for 3D consistency. We introduce \\textbf{ViewRope}, a geometry-aware encoding that injects camera-ray directions directly into video transformer self-attention layers. By parameterizing attention with relative ray geometry rather than pixel locality, ViewRope provides a model-native inductive bias for retrieving 3D-consistent content across temporal gaps. We further propose \\textbf{Geometry-Aware Frame-Sparse Attention}, which exploits these geometric cues to selectively attend to relevant historical frames, improving efficiency without sacrificing memory consistency.

Such misaligned actions may arise from external attacks (e.g., indirect prompt injection) or from internal limitations (e.g., erroneous reasoning). They not only expose CUAs to safety risks, but also degrade task efficiency and reliability. This work makes the first effort to define and study misaligned action detection in CUAs, with comprehensive coverage of both externally induced and internally arising misaligned actions. We further identify three common categories in real-world CUA deployment and construct MisActBench, a benchmark of realistic trajectories with human-annotated, action-level alignment labels. Moreover, we propose DeAction, a practical and universal guardrail that detects misaligned actions before execution and iteratively corrects them through structured feedback. DeAction outperforms all existing baselines across offline and online evaluations with moderate latency overhead: (1) On MisActBench, it outperforms baselines by over 15% absolute in F1 score; (2) In online evaluation, it reduces attack success rate by over 90% under adversarial settings while preserving or even improving task success rate in benign environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff08CUAs\uff09\u4e2d\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u79bb\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ca\u7ea0\u6b63\u673a\u5236DeAction\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\uff08CUAs\uff09\u8fdb\u5c55\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u4ecd\u5e38\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u79bb\u65e2\u53ef\u80fd\u6765\u81ea\u5916\u90e8\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5982\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u6e90\u4e8e\u81ea\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u9690\u60a3\u548c\u6548\u7387\u635f\u5931\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u6b64\u7c7b\u504f\u79bb\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u6b21\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86CUA\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u79bb\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u7531\u5916\u90e8\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u504f\u79bb\uff1b\u5212\u5206\u4e86CUA\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u7c7b\u5e38\u89c1\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u4eba\u5de5\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6MisActBench\u3002\u968f\u540e\u63d0\u51faDeAction\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u504f\u79bb\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6267\u884c\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fee\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\uff081\uff09Offline\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0cDeAction\u5728MisActBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u9886\u5148\u57fa\u7ebf15%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff1b\uff082\uff09Online\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u9762\u5bf9\u653b\u51fbDeAction\u80fd\u5c06\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8590%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6b63\u5e38\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9002\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "DeAction\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63CUA\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u504f\u79bb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u53ca\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Project page: https://maxmilite.github.io/rec-from-ultrafast-blur/", "summary": "We consider the problem of 3D shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While 3D reconstruction from static images has been extensively studied, recovering geometry from extreme motion-blurred images remains challenging. Such scenarios frequently occur in both natural and industrial settings, such as fast-moving objects in sports (e.g., balls) or rotating machinery, where rapid motion distorts object appearance and makes traditional 3D reconstruction techniques like Multi-View Stereo (MVS) ineffective.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel inverse rendering approach for shape recovery from ultra-fast motion-blurred images. While conventional rendering techniques typically synthesize blur by averaging across multiple frames, we identify a major computational bottleneck in the repeated computation of barycentric weights. To address this, we propose a fast barycentric coordinate solver, which significantly reduces computational overhead and achieves a speedup of up to 4.57x, enabling efficient and photorealistic simulation of high-speed motion. Crucially, our method is fully differentiable, allowing gradients to propagate from rendered images to the underlying 3D shape, thereby facilitating shape recovery through inverse rendering.\n  We validate our approach on two representative motion types: rapid translation and rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enables efficient and realistic modeling of ultra-fast moving objects in the forward simulation. Moreover, it successfully recovers 3D shapes from 2D imagery of objects undergoing extreme translational and rotational motion, advancing the boundaries of vision-based 3D reconstruction.

SSI-Bench contains 1,000 ranking questions spanning geometric and topological reasoning and requiring a diverse repertoire of compositional spatial operations, such as mental rotation, cross-sectional inference, occlusion reasoning, and force-path reasoning. It is created via a fully human-centered pipeline: ten researchers spent over 400 hours curating images, annotating structural components, and designing questions to minimize pixel-level cues. Evaluating 31 widely used VLMs reveals a large gap to humans: the best open-source model achieves 22.2% accuracy and the strongest closed-source model reaches 33.6%, while humans score 91.6%.

Progress is further limited by the scarcity of large, well-annotated datasets for case-based medical image retrieval. We introduce WristMIR, a region-aware pediatric wrist radiograph retrieval framework that leverages dense radiology reports and bone-specific localization to learn fine-grained, clinically meaningful image representations without any manual image-level annotations. Using MedGemma-based structured report mining to generate both global and region-level captions, together with pre-processed wrist images and bone-specific crops of the distal radius, distal ulna, and ulnar styloid, WristMIR jointly trains global and local contrastive encoders and performs a two-stage retrieval process: (1) coarse global matching to identify candidate exams, followed by (2) region-conditioned reranking aligned to a predefined anatomical bone region. WristMIR improves retrieval performance over strong vision-language baselines, raising image-to-text Recall@5 from 0.82% to 9.35%. Its embeddings also yield stronger fracture classification (AUROC 0.949, AUPRC 0.953). In region-aware evaluation, the two-stage design markedly improves retrieval-based fracture diagnosis, increasing mean $F_1$ from 0.568 to 0.753, and radiologists rate its retrieved cases as more clinically relevant, with mean scores rising from 3.36 to 4.35. These findings highlight the potential of anatomically guided retrieval to enhance diagnostic reasoning and support clinical decision-making in pediatric musculoskeletal imaging.

While Internet videos offer virtually unlimited raw data, utilizing them as a scaling source for geometric learning is challenging due to the absence of ground-truth geometry and the presence of observational noise. To address this, we propose SAGE, a framework for Scalable Adaptation of GEometric foundation models from raw video streams. SAGE leverages a hierarchical mining pipeline to transform videos into training trajectories and hybrid supervision: (1) Informative training trajectory selection; (2) Sparse Geometric Anchoring via SfM point clouds for global structural guidance; and (3) Dense Differentiable Consistency via 3D Gaussian rendering for multi-view constraints. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a regularization strategy using anchor data. Extensive experiments show that SAGE significantly enhances zero-shot generalization, reducing Chamfer Distance by 20-42% on unseen benchmarks (7Scenes, TUM-RGBD, Matterport3D) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

By contrast, in vision-language models (VLMs), substantial differences between visual and text tokens in their activation distributions and sensitivities to quantization error pose significant challenges for effective calibration during PTQ. In this work, we rethink what PTQ calibration should align with in VLMs and propose the Token-level Importance-aware Layer-wise Quantization framework (TLQ). Guided by gradient information, we design a token-level importance integration mechanism for quantization error, and use it to construct a token-level calibration set, enabling a more fine-grained calibration strategy. Furthermore, TLQ introduces a multi-GPU, quantization-exposed layer-wise calibration scheme. This scheme keeps the layer-wise calibration procedure consistent with the true quantized inference path and distributes the complex layer-wise calibration workload across multiple RTX3090 GPUs, thereby reducing reliance on the large memory of A100 GPUs. TLQ is evaluated across two models, three model scales, and two quantization settings, consistently achieving performance improvements across all settings, indicating its strong quantization stability.

Existing VLLMs acceleration frameworks usually compress spatial and temporal redundancy independently, which overlooks the spatiotemporal relationships, thereby leading to suboptimal spatiotemporal compression. The highly correlated visual features are likely to change in spatial position, scale, orientation, and other attributes over time due to the dynamic nature of video. Building on this insight, we introduce FlashVID, a training-free inference acceleration framework for VLLMs. Specifically, FlashVID utilizes Attention and Diversity-based Token Selection (ADTS) to select the most representative tokens for basic video representation, then applies Tree-based Spatiotemporal Token Merging (TSTM) for fine-grained spatiotemporal redundancy elimination. Extensive experiments conducted on three representative VLLMs across five video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Notably, by retaining only 10% of visual tokens, FlashVID preserves 99.1% of the performance of LLaVA-OneVision. Consequently, FlashVID can serve as a training-free and plug-and-play module for extending long video frames, which enables a 10x increase in video frame input to Qwen2.5-VL, resulting in a relative improvement of 8.6% within the same computational budget.

Project page: https://adaptive-visual-tts.github.io/", "summary": "Despite rapid progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), visual spatial reasoning remains unreliable when correct answers depend on how a scene would appear under unseen or alternative viewpoints. Recent work addresses this by augmenting reasoning with world models for visual imagination, but questions such as when imagination is actually necessary, how much of it is beneficial, and when it becomes harmful, remain poorly understood. In practice, indiscriminate imagination can increase computation and even degrade performance by introducing misleading evidence. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of test-time visual imagination as a controllable resource for spatial reasoning. We study when static visual evidence is sufficient, when imagination improves reasoning, and how excessive or unnecessary imagination affects accuracy and efficiency. To support this analysis, we introduce AVIC, an adaptive test-time framework with world models that explicitly reasons about the sufficiency of current visual evidence before selectively invoking and scaling visual imagination. Across spatial reasoning benchmarks (SAT, MMSI) and an embodied navigation benchmark (R2R), our results reveal clear scenarios where imagination is critical, marginal, or detrimental, and show that selective control can match or outperform fixed imagination strategies with substantially fewer world-model calls and language tokens. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of analyzing and controlling test-time imagination for efficient and reliable spatial reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6AVIC\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u8c03\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u6b65\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u975e\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u589e\u5f3a\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u76f2\u76ee\u60f3\u8c61\u5374\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u8d1f\u62c5\u751a\u81f3\u8bef\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAVIC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u4f55\u65f6\u5f53\u524d\u8bc1\u636e\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u52a0\u5f3a\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u8c03\u7528\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982SAT\u3001MMSI\u3001R2R\uff09\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u90e8\u5206\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5219\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u65e0\u8c13\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u3002AVIC\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u60f3\u8c61\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00Token\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u89c6\u89c9\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u662f\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0cAVIC\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose to leverage local and global density characteristics to guide the model of crowd counting for unseen surveillance scenes. Specifically, to enable the model to adapt to the varying density variations in the target scene, we propose the multiple local density learner to learn multi prototypes which represent different density distributions in the support scene. Subsequently, these multiple local density similarity matrixes are encoded. And they are utilized to guide the model in a local way. To further adapt to the global density in the target scene, the global density features are extracted from the support image, then it is used to guide the model in a global way.

However, existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to learn it, as effective self-correction behaviors emerge only rarely, making learning signals extremely sparse. To address this challenge, we propose correction-specific rollouts (Octopus), an RL rollout augmentation framework that synthesizes dense self-correction examples by recombining existing rollouts. This augmentation simultaneously improves sample efficiency due to rollout reuse and stabilizes RL optimization through balanced supervision. Furthermore, we introduce a response-masking strategy that decouples self-correction from direct reasoning, avoiding signal conflicts and enabling both behaviors to be learned effectively. Building on this, we introduce Octopus-8B, a reasoning VLM with controllable self-correction capability.

We introduce D-ORCA, a \\textbf{d}ialogue-centric \\textbf{o}mni-modal large language model optimized for \\textbf{r}obust audio-visual \\textbf{ca}ptioning. We further curate DVD, a large-scale, high-quality bilingual dataset comprising nearly 40,000 multi-party dialogue videos for training and 2000 videos for evaluation in English and Mandarin, addressing a critical gap in the open-source ecosystem. To ensure fine-grained captioning accuracy, we adopt group relative policy optimization with three novel reward functions that assess speaker attribution accuracy, global speech content accuracy, and sentence-level temporal boundary alignment. These rewards are derived from evaluation metrics widely used in speech processing and, to our knowledge, are applied for the first time as reinforcement learning objectives for audio-visual captioning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ORCA substantially outperforms existing open-source models in speaker identification, speech recognition, and temporal grounding.

Recent studies have shown that using differentiable rewards to directly align the preference of diffusion models yields promising results. However, these methods suffer from (1) inefficient and coarse-grained optimization with (2) high memory consumption. In this work, we first theoretically and empirically identify the key reason of these limitations: the recursive dependence between different steps in the denoising trajectory. Inspired by this insight, we propose EasyTune, which fine-tunes diffusion at each denoising step rather than over the entire trajectory. This decouples the recursive dependence, allowing us to perform (1) a dense and fine-grained, and (2) memory-efficient optimization. Furthermore, the scarcity of preference motion pairs restricts the availability of motion reward model training. To this end, we further introduce a Self-refinement Preference Learning (SPL) mechanism that dynamically identifies preference pairs and conducts preference learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EasyTune outperforms DRaFT-50 by 8.2% in alignment (MM-Dist) improvement while requiring only 31.16% of its additional memory overhead and achieving a 7.3x training speedup.

However, under ultra-low-dose conditions, the sharply degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in energy-specific projections poses a significant challenge, leading to severe artifacts and loss of structural details in reconstructed images. To address this, we propose FSP-Diff, a full-spectrum prior-enhanced dual-domain latent diffusion framework for ultra-low-dose spectral CT reconstruction. Our framework integrates three core strategies: 1) Complementary Feature Construction: We integrate direct image reconstructions with projection-domain denoised results. While the former preserves latent textural nuances amidst heavy noise, the latter provides a stable structural scaffold to balance detail fidelity and noise suppression. 2) Full-Spectrum Prior Integration: By fusing multi-energy projections into a high-SNR full-spectrum image, we establish a unified structural reference that guides the reconstruction across all energy bins. 3) Efficient Latent Diffusion Synthesis: To alleviate the high computational burden of high-dimensional spectral data, multi-path features are embedded into a compact latent space. This allows the diffusion process to facilitate interactive feature fusion in a lower-dimensional manifold, achieving accelerated reconstruction while maintaining fine-grained detail restoration.

Ultra-sparse angular sampling, employed to reduce dose, introduces severe undersampling artifacts and inter-slice inconsistencies, compromising diagnostic reliability. Existing reconstruction methods often struggle to balance angular continuity with spatial detail fidelity. To address these challenges, we propose a Continuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors (CSDN) for ultra-sparse-view CBCT reconstruction. Neural priors are introduced as a structural foundation to encode a continuous threedimensional attenuation representation, enabling the synthesis of physically consistent dense projections from ultra-sparse measurements. Building upon this neural-prior-based initialization, a synergistic diffusion strategy is developed, consisting of two collaborative refinement paths: a Sinogram Refinement Diffusion (Sino-RD) process that restores angular continuity and a Digital Radiography Refinement Diffusion (DR-RD) process that enforces inter-slice consistency from the projection image perspective. The outputs of the two diffusion paths are adaptively fused by the Dual-Projection Reconstruction Fusion (DPRF) module to achieve coherent volumetric reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSDN effectively suppresses artifacts and recovers fine textures under ultra-sparse-view conditions, outperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCSDN\uff08Continuity-driven Synergistic Diffusion with Neural priors\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u89d2\u5ea6\u91c7\u6837\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9525\u5f62\u675fCT\uff08CBCT\uff09\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "CBCT\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u517c\u987e\u8f90\u5c04\u5242\u91cf\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u867d\u7136\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8f90\u5c04\u5242\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bca\u65ad\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u89d2\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f15\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u5148\u9a8c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u5efa\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6\u6295\u5f71\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u534f\u540c\u6269\u6563\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ecSinogram\uff08\u6295\u5f71\u6570\u636e\uff09\u6269\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u5c04\u7ebf\u7167\u7247\uff08DR\uff09\u6269\u6563\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6295\u5f71\u91cd\u5efa\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u8def\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCSDN\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8d85\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CSDN\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347CBCT\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f4e\u5242\u91cf\u6210\u50cf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Emerging techniques, such as diffusion-based models and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), alongside enhancements in traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have contributed to the sophisticated generation of deepfake videos. Concurrently, deepfake detection methods have seen notable progress, driven by innovations in Transformer architectures, contrastive learning, and other machine learning approaches. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of state-of-the-art deepfake detection techniques, including human evaluation experiments against cutting-edge synthesis methods. Our findings highlight a concerning trend: many state-of-the-art detection models exhibit markedly poor performance when challenged with deepfakes produced by modern synthesis techniques, including poor performance by human participants against the best quality deepfakes. Through extensive experimentation, we provide evidence that underscores the urgent need for continued refinement of detection models to keep pace with the evolving capabilities of deepfake generation technologies.

However, existing methods remain limited to relatively simple editing operations, hindering real-world applications that require complex and compositional instructions. In this work, we address these limitations from the perspectives of architectural design, data, and evaluation protocols. Specifically, we identify two key challenges in current models: insufficient instruction compliance and background inconsistency. To this end, we propose MCIE-E1, a Multimodal Large Language Model-Driven Complex Instruction Image Editing method that integrates two key modules: a spatial-aware cross-attention module and a background-consistent cross-attention module. The former enhances instruction-following capability by explicitly aligning semantic instructions with spatial regions through spatial guidance during the denoising process, while the latter preserves features in unedited regions to maintain background consistency. To enable effective training, we construct a dedicated data pipeline to mitigate the scarcity of complex instruction-based image editing datasets, combining fine-grained automatic filtering via a powerful MLLM with rigorous human validation. Finally, to comprehensively evaluate complex instruction-based image editing, we introduce CIE-Bench, a new benchmark with two new evaluation metrics. Experimental results on CIE-Bench demonstrate that MCIE-E1 consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, achieving a 23.96% improvement in instruction compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MCIE-E1\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u9700\u6c42\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMCIE-E1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u63d0\u5347\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4fdd\u6301\u672a\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u642d\u5efa\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408MLLM\u81ea\u52a8\u7b5b\u9009\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6CIE-Bench\u53ca\u4e24\u9879\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIE-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5b9a\u91cf\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0cMCIE-E1\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u6027\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e8623.96%\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "MCIE-E1\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u80cc\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6548\u679c\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u5bf9\u63a8\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Most existing methods enforce physical validity through soft penalties, creating an intrinsic trade-off between geometric feasibility and physical plausibility: penalizing collisions often distorts mesh structure, while preserving shape leads to interpenetration. To resolve this conflict, we present PhysDrape, a hybrid neural-physical solver for physically realistic garment draping driven by explicit forces and constraints. Unlike soft-constrained frameworks, PhysDrape integrates neural inference with explicit geometric solvers in a fully differentiable pipeline. Specifically, we propose a Physics-Informed Graph Neural Network conditioned on a physics-enriched graph -- encoding material parameters and body proximity -- to predict residual displacements. Crucially, we integrate a differentiable two-stage solver: first, a learnable Force Solver iteratively resolves unbalanced forces derived from the Saint Venant-Kirchhoff (StVK) model to ensure quasi-static equilibrium; second, a Differentiable Projection strictly enforces collision constraints against the body surface. This differentiable design guarantees physical validity through explicit constraints, while enabling end-to-end learning to optimize the network for physically consistent predictions.

To address this gap, we introduce MIND, the first open-domain closed-loop revisited benchmark for evaluating Memory consIstency and action coNtrol in worlD models. MIND contains 250 high-quality videos at 1080p and 24 FPS, including 100 (first-person) + 100 (third-person) video clips under a shared action space and 25 + 25 clips across varied action spaces covering eight diverse scenes. We design an efficient evaluation framework to measure two core abilities: memory consistency and action control, capturing temporal stability and contextual coherence across viewpoints. Furthermore, we design various action spaces, including different character movement speeds and camera rotation angles, to evaluate the action generalization capability across different action spaces under shared scenes. To facilitate future performance benchmarking on MIND, we introduce MIND-World, a novel interactive Video-to-World baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the completeness of MIND and reveal key challenges in current world models, including the difficulty of maintaining long-term memory consistency and generalizing across action spaces.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in synthesizing realistic visual data. However, they often struggle to capture complex and diverse data distributions, particularly in scenarios involving incomplete inputs or significant missing regions. These challenges arise mainly from the high computational requirements and the difficulty of modeling heterogeneous and structurally intricate data, which restrict their applicability in real-world settings. Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a promising solution to these limitations. By dynamically selecting and activating the most relevant expert sub-networks for a given input, MoEs improve both performance and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the integration of Deep 3D Convolutional GANs (CGANs) with a MoE framework to generate high-quality 3D models and reconstruct incomplete or damaged objects. The proposed architecture incorporates multiple generators, each specialized to capture distinct modalities within the dataset. Furthermore, an auxiliary loss-free dynamic capacity constraint (DCC) mechanism is introduced to guide the selection of categorical generators, ensuring a balance between specialization, training stability, and computational efficiency, which is critical for 3D voxel processing. We evaluated the model's ability to generate and complete shapes with missing regions of varying sizes and compared its performance with state-of-the-art approaches.

However, existing equivariant ViTs often struggle to balance performance with equivariance, primarily due to the challenge of achieving holistic equivariant modifications across the diverse modules in ViTs-particularly in harmonizing the Self-Attention mechanism with Patch Embedding. To address this, we propose a straightforward framework that systematically renders key ViT components, including patch embedding, self-attention, positional encodings, and Down/Up-Sampling, equivariant, thereby constructing ViTs with guaranteed equivariance. The resulting architecture serves as a plug-and-play replacement that is both theoretically grounded and practically versatile, scaling seamlessly even to Swin Transformers.

First, YOLO 11x detects and crops human portraits frame-by-frame, and DINOv2-Base extracts visual features from the cropped regions. Next, by integrating Chain-of-Thought and Reflection prompting (CoT + Reflection), Gemini 2.5 Pro automatically generates pseudo-labels and reasoning texts that serve as weak supervision for downstream models. Subsequently, OpenPose produces 137-dimensional key-point sequences, augmented with inter-frame offset features; the usual graph neural network backbone is simplified to an MLP to efficiently model the spatiotemporal relationships of the three key-point streams. An ultra-long-sequence Transformer independently encodes both the image and key-point sequences, and their representations are concatenated with BERT-encoded interview transcripts. Each modality is first pre-trained in isolation, then fine-tuned jointly, with pseudo-labeled samples merged into the training set for further gains. Experiments demonstrate that, despite severe class imbalance, the proposed approach lifts accuracy from under 0.6 in prior work to over 0.69, establishing a new public benchmark.

In deployed platforms, this raises copyright and intellectual-property risks and calls for reliable protection. However, existing countermeasures either require costly weight editing as new styles emerge or rely on an explicitly specified editing style, limiting their practicality for deployment-side safety. To address this challenge, we propose DICE (Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition), a training-free framework for on-the-fly artist style erasure. Unlike style editing that require an explicitly specified replacement style, DICE performs style purification, removing the artist's characteristics while preserving the user-intended content. Our core insight is that a model cannot truly comprehend the artist style from a single text or image alone. Consequently, we abandon the traditional paradigm of identifying style from isolated samples. Instead, we construct contrastive triplets to compel the model to distinguish between style and non-style features in the latent space. By formalizing this disentanglement process as a solvable generalized eigenvalue problem, we achieve precise identification of the style subspace. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Attention Decoupling Editing strategy dynamically assesses the style concentration of each token and performs differential suppression and content enhancement on the QKV vectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DICE achieves a superior balance between the thoroughness of style erasure and the preservation of content integrity. DICE introduces an additional overhead of only 3 seconds to disentangle style, providing a practical and efficient technique for curbing style mimicry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DICE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u7aef\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5730\u5feb\u901f\u53bb\u9664\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u6a21\u4eff\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u6a21\u4eff\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u72ec\u7279\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7248\u6743\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u6743\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5fc5\u987b\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u66ff\u6362\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DICE\uff08Disentanglement of artist Style from Content via Contrastive Subspace Decomposition\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2atoken\u52a8\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u683c\u6d53\u5ea6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u98ce\u683c\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDICE\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u53bb\u9664\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u5185\u5bb9\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea63\u79d2\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "DICE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u53bb\u9664\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e3a\u9632\u6b62\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u98ce\u683c\u4eff\u5192\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u6743\u76ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically adapt pre-trained video models using camera poses relative to a fixed reference, e.g., the first frame. However, these encodings lack shift-invariance, often leading to poor generalization and accumulated drift. While relative camera pose embeddings defined between arbitrary view pairs offer a more robust alternative, integrating them into pre-trained video diffusion models without prohibitive training costs or architectural changes remains challenging. We introduce ReRoPE, a plug-and-play framework that incorporates relative camera information into pre-trained video diffusion models without compromising their generation capability. Our approach is based on the insight that Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) in existing models underutilize their full spectral bandwidth, particularly in the low-frequency components. By seamlessly injecting relative camera pose information into these underutilized bands, ReRoPE achieves precise control while preserving strong pre-trained generative priors.

While preserving the canonical Attention-FFN structure, we conduct a component-wise refinement involving normalization, activation functions, positional encoding, gating mechanisms, and learnable tokens. These updates form a new generation of Vision Transformers, which we call ViT-5. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-5 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art plain Vision Transformers across both understanding and generation benchmarks. On ImageNet-1k classification, ViT-5-Base reaches 84.2\\% top-1 accuracy under comparable compute, exceeding DeiT-III-Base at 83.8\\%. ViT-5 also serves as a stronger backbone for generative modeling: when plugged into an SiT diffusion framework, it achieves 1.84 FID versus 2.06 with a vanilla ViT backbone. Beyond headline metrics, ViT-5 exhibits improved representation learning and favorable spatial reasoning behavior, and transfers reliably across tasks. With a design aligned with contemporary foundation-model practices, ViT-5 offers a simple drop-in upgrade over vanilla ViT for mid-2020s vision backbones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aViT-5\u7684\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3Vision Transformer\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9\u539f\u6709ViT\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\uff0cVision Transformer\uff08ViT\uff09\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u81ea\u63d0\u51fa\u540e\u53d8\u5316\u4e0d\u5927\u3002\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u987a\u5e94\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e94\u5e74\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u9769\u65b0\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5bf9ViT\u505a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u73b0\u4ee3\u5316\u5347\u7ea7\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301Attention-FFN\u4e3b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9ViT\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60token\u7b49\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u9879\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u66f4\u65b0\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3aViT-5\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "ViT-5\u5728\u4f17\u591a\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982ImageNet-1k\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7b49\uff09\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684ViT\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cViT-5-Base\u5728ImageNet-1k\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523084.2%\u7684top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684FID\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178ViT\u3002", "conclusion": "ViT-5\u4ee5\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u5438\u6536\u4e86\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765Vision\u9886\u57df\u7684\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u4e3b\u6d41\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u65e0\u7f1d\u66ff\u6362\u4f20\u7edfViT\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u662f\u9762\u54112020\u5e74\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u9aa8\u5e72\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

However, their performance on video remains inferior to Video Foundation Models (VFMs). In this paper, we focus on leveraging MLLMs for video-text embedding and retrieval. We first conduct a systematic layer-wise analysis, showing that intermediate (pre-trained) MLLM layers already encode substantial task-relevant information. Leveraging this insight, we demonstrate that combining intermediate-layer embeddings with a calibrated MLLM head yields strong zero-shot retrieval performance without any training. Building on these findings, we introduce a lightweight text-based alignment strategy which maps dense video captions to short summaries and enables task-related video-text embedding learning without visual supervision.

MMLSv2 consists of multimodal imagery with seven bands: RGB, digital elevation model, slope, thermal inertia, and grayscale channels. MMLSv2 comprises 664 images distributed across training, validation, and test splits. In addition, an isolated test set of 276 images from a geographically disjoint region from the base dataset is released to evaluate spatial generalization. Experiments conducted with multiple segmentation models show that the dataset supports stable training and achieves competitive performance, while still posing challenges in fragmented, elongated, and small-scale landslide regions.

We propose a targeted patch-based pre-processing pipeline to isolate structural features and minimize background noise in training. We adopt a frozen-head fine-tuning strategy to keep computational requirements manageable. Model performance is evaluated through accuracy, precision, recall, and macro-averaged F1 scores.

Cameras provide dense visual cues but ill posed depth; LiDAR provides a precise 3D structure but sparse coverage. Existing BEV-based fusion frameworks have made good progress, but they have difficulties including inefficient context modeling, spatially invariant fusion, and reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce MambaFusion, a unified multi-modal detection framework that achieves efficient, adaptive, and physically grounded 3D perception. MambaFusion interleaves selective state-space models (SSMs) with windowed transformers to propagate the global context in linear time while preserving local geometric fidelity. A multi-modal token alignment (MTA) module and reliability-aware fusion gates dynamically re-weight camera-LiDAR features based on spatial confidence and calibration consistency.

Recent work proposed several visual jailbreak attacks using single/ holistic images. However, contemporary VLMs demonstrate strong robustness against such attacks due to extensive safety alignment through preference optimization (e.g., RLHF). In this work, we identify a new vulnerability: while VLM pretraining and instruction tuning generalize well to split-image inputs, safety alignment is typically performed only on holistic images and does not account for harmful semantics distributed across multiple image fragments. Consequently, VLMs often fail to detect and refuse harmful split-image inputs, where unsafe cues emerge only after combining images. We introduce novel split-image visual jailbreak attacks (SIVA) that exploit this misalignment. Unlike prior optimization-based attacks, which exhibit poor black-box transferability due to architectural and prior mismatches across models, our attacks evolve in progressive phases from naive splitting to an adaptive white-box attack, culminating in a black-box transfer attack. Our strongest strategy leverages a novel adversarial knowledge distillation (Adv-KD) algorithm to substantially improve cross-model transferability. Evaluations on three state-of-the-art modern VLMs and three jailbreak datasets demonstrate that our strongest attack achieves up to 60% higher transfer success than existing baselines. Lastly, we propose efficient ways to address this critical vulnerability in the current VLM safety alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u9762\u5411\u62c6\u5206\u56fe\u7247\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u62c6\u5206\u56fe\u7247\u89c6\u89c9\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff08SIVA\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7ed5\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1VLM\u7ecf\u7531RLHF\u7b49\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5df2\u6709\u9632\u62a4\u53ef\u5e94\u5bf9\u76f4\u63a5/\u6574\u4f53\u56fe\u7247\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u5bf9\u7531\u591a\u4e2a\u65e0\u5bb3\u56fe\u7247\u7247\u6bb5\u7ec4\u5408\u540e\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u8db3\u591f\u9632\u62a4\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u62c6\u5206\u56fe\u7247\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9010\u6b65\u5347\u7ea7\u7684\u62c6\u5206\u56fe\u7247\u89c6\u89c9\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff08SIVA\uff09\uff1a\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\u7247\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6f14\u8fdb\u81f3\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u767d\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08Adv-KD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f3a\u529bSIVA\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdbVLM\u53ca\u4e09\u5957\u8d8a\u72f1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe\u5230\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad860%\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86VLM\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u4e5f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8VLM\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5b8c\u5584\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose DAS-SK, a novel lightweight architecture that retrofits selective kernel convolution (SK-Conv) into the dual atrous separable convolution (DAS-Conv) module to strengthen multi-scale feature learning. The model further enhances the atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module, enabling the capture of fine-grained local structures alongside global contextual information. Built upon a modified DeepLabV3 framework with two complementary backbones - MobileNetV3-Large and EfficientNet-B3, the DAS-SK model mitigates limitations associated with large dataset requirements, limited spectral generalization, and the high computational cost that typically restricts deployment on UAVs and other edge devices. Comprehensive experiments across three benchmarks: LandCover.ai, VDD, and PhenoBench, demonstrate that DAS-SK consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, while being more efficient than CNN-, transformer-, and hybrid-based competitors. Notably, DAS-SK requires up to 21x fewer parameters and 19x fewer GFLOPs than top-performing transformer models. These findings establish DAS-SK as a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for real-time agricultural robotics and high-resolution remote sensing, with strong potential for broader deployment in other vision domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DAS-SK\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u519c\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u519c\u4e1a\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u666e\u904d\u6a21\u578b\u5e9e\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u9ad8\u6216\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAS-SK\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728DAS-Conv\uff08\u53cc\u7a7a\u6d1e\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5377\u79ef\uff08SK-Conv\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86ASPP\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u7684DeepLabV3\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u91c7\u7528MobileNetV3-Large\u4e0eEfficientNet-B3\u53cc\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8c31\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728LandCover.ai\u3001VDD\u548cPhenoBench\u4e09\u5927\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cDAS-SK\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5237\u65b0\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709CNN\u3001Transformer\u53ca\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u9ad821\u500d\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff08GFLOPs\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u9ad819\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "DAS-SK\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95f4\u8fbe\u6210\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3001\u519c\u4e1a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u4e5f\u6709\u63a8\u5e7f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Under peer review", "summary": "Estimating Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) from echocardiograms constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem. Inherent noise, artifacts, and limited viewing angles introduce ambiguity, where a single video sequence may map not to a unique ground truth, but rather to a distribution of plausible physiological values. Prevailing deep learning approaches typically formulate this task as a standard regression problem that minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, this paradigm compels the model to learn the conditional expectation, which may yield misleading predictions when the underlying posterior distribution is multimodal or heavy-tailed -- a common phenomenon in pathological scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the paradigm shift from deterministic regression toward generative regression. We propose the Multimodal Conditional Score-based Diffusion model for Regression (MCSDR), a probabilistic framework designed to model the continuous posterior distribution of LVEF conditioned on echocardiogram videos and patient demographic attribute priors. Extensive experiments conducted on the EchoNet-Dynamic, EchoNet-Pediatric, and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that MCSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, existing methods predominantly rely on the passive mapping of visual features and textual embeddings. This ``appearance-based\" paradigm lacks geospatial contextual awareness, leading to severe semantic ambiguity and misclassification when encountering land-cover classes with similar spectral features but distinct semantic attributes. To address this, we propose a Geospatial Reasoning Chain-of-Thought (GR-CoT) framework designed to enhance the scene understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), thereby guiding open-vocabulary segmentation models toward precise mapping. The framework comprises two collaborative components: an offline knowledge distillation stream and an online instance reasoning stream. The offline stream establishes fine-grained category interpretation standards to resolve semantic conflicts between similar land-cover types. During online inference, the framework executes a sequential reasoning process involving macro-scenario anchoring, visual feature decoupling, and knowledge-driven decision synthesis. This process generates an image-adaptive vocabulary that guides downstream models to achieve pixel-level alignment with correct geographical semantics.

In this paper, we analyse the effect of various techniques for providing additional visual and textual context via tool use to the MLLM and its effect on the REC task. Furthermore, we propose a training-free framework named Chain-of-Caption to improve the REC performance of MLLMs. We perform experiments on RefCOCO/RefCOCOg/RefCOCO+ and Ref-L4 datasets and show that individual textual or visual context can improve the REC performance without any fine-tuning.

Although there have been efforts to improve the efficiency of SAM2, most of them focus on retraining a lightweight backbone, with little exploration into post-training acceleration. In this paper, we observe that SAM2 exhibits sparse perception pattern as biological vision, which provides opportunities for eliminating redundant computation and acceleration: i) In mask decoder, the attention primarily focuses on the foreground objects, whereas the image encoder in the earlier stage exhibits a broad attention span, which results in unnecessary computation to background regions. ii) In memory bank, only a small subset of tokens in each frame contribute significantly to memory attention, and the salient regions exhibit temporal consistency, making full-token computation redundant. With these insights, we propose Efficient-SAM2, which promotes SAM2 to adaptively focus on object regions while eliminating task-irrelevant computations, thereby significantly improving inference efficiency. Specifically, for image encoder, we propose object-aware Sparse Window Routing (SWR), a window-level computation allocation mechanism that leverages the consistency and saliency cues from the previous-frame decoder to route background regions into a lightweight shortcut branch. Moreover, for memory attention, we propose object-aware Sparse Memory Retrieval (SMR), which allows only the salient memory tokens in each frame to participate in computation, with the saliency pattern reused from their first recollection. With negligible additional parameters and minimal training overhead, Efficient-SAM2 delivers 1.68x speedup on SAM2.1-L model with only 1.0% accuracy drop on SA-V test set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEfficient-SAM2\uff0c\u4ee5\u7cbe\u7b80SAM2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5272\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.68\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "SAM2\u867d\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u963b\u788d\u5176\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u518d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6ce8\u610f\u5230SAM2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u5b58\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faEfficient-SAM2\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u5927\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u90e8\u5206\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7a97\u53e3\u8def\u7531\uff08SWR\uff09\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u524d\u5e27\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5c06\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u8def\u7531\u5230\u66f4\u7b80\u5316\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u65e0\u5173\u8ba1\u7b97\u30022\uff09\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u90e8\u5206\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\uff08SMR\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u8ba9\u6bcf\u5e27\u4e2d\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7684tokens\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u590d\u7528\u9996\u6b21\u68c0\u7d22\u51fa\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53bb\u9664\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5168token\u8fd0\u7b97\u3002", "result": "Efficient-SAM2\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff08\u4ee5SAM2.1-L\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.68\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ec5\u5e26\u67651%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "Efficient-SAM2\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86SAM2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

A pressing challenge arises from the vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples, which poses a significant threat to the reliability of event-based systems. Nevertheless, research into adversarial attacks on events is scarce. This is primarily due to the non-differentiable nature of mainstream event representations, which hinders the extension of gradient-based attack methods. In this paper, we propose MA-ADV, a novel \\textbf{M}otion-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{Adv}ersarial framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to generate adversarial events by leveraging point cloud representations. MA-ADV accounts for high-frequency noise in events and employs a diffusion-based approach to smooth perturbations, while fully leveraging the spatial and temporal relationships among events. Finally, MA-ADV identifies the minimal-cost perturbation through a combination of sample-wise Adam optimization, iterative refinement, and binary search.

However, most existing methods rely on functional connectivity (FC) via Pearson correlation, which reduces 4D BOLD signals to static 2D matrices, discarding temporal dynamics and capturing only linear inter-regional relationships. In this work, we benchmark state-of-the-art temporal models (e.g., time-series models such as PatchTST, TimesNet, and TimeMixer) on raw BOLD signals across five public datasets. Results show these models consistently outperform traditional FC-based approaches, highlighting the value of directly modeling temporal information such as cycle-like oscillatory fluctuations and drift-like slow baseline trends. Building on this insight, we propose DeCI, a simple yet effective framework that integrates two key principles: (i) Cycle and Drift Decomposition to disentangle cycle and drift within each ROI (Region of Interest); and (ii) Channel-Independence to model each ROI separately, improving robustness and reducing overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCI achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization compared to both FC-based and temporal baselines. Our findings advocate for a shift toward end-to-end temporal modeling in fMRI analysis to better capture complex brain dynamics.

In professional AI-assisted filmmaking, it is crucial to perform precise, targeted modifications. A cornerstone of this transition is video instance insertion, which requires inserting a specific instance into existing footage while maintaining scene integrity. Unlike traditional video editing, this task demands several requirements: precise spatial-temporal placement, physically consistent scene interaction, and the faithful preservation of original dynamics - all achieved under minimal user effort. In this paper, we propose PISCO, a video diffusion model for precise video instance insertion with arbitrary sparse keyframe control. PISCO allows users to specify a single keyframe, start-and-end keyframes, or sparse keyframes at arbitrary timestamps, and automatically propagates object appearance, motion, and interaction. To address the severe distribution shift induced by sparse conditioning in pretrained video diffusion models, we introduce Variable-Information Guidance for robust conditioning and Distribution-Preserving Temporal Masking to stabilize temporal generation, together with geometry-aware conditioning for realistic scene adaptation. We further construct PISCO-Bench, a benchmark with verified instance annotations and paired clean background videos, and evaluate performance using both reference-based and reference-free perceptual metrics. Experiments demonstrate that PISCO consistently outperforms strong inpainting and video editing baselines under sparse control, and exhibits clear, monotonic performance improvements as additional control signals are provided.

Presence-Absence (PA) data provide accurate and noise-free labels, but are costly to obtain and limited in quantity; Presence-Only (PO) data, by contrast, offer broad spatial coverage and rich spatiotemporal distribution, but suffer from severe label noise in negative samples. To address these real-world constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal fusion framework that fully leverages the strengths of both PA and PO data. We introduce an innovative pseudo-label aggregation strategy for PO data based on the geographic coverage of satellite imagery, enabling geographic alignment between the label space and remote sensing feature space. In terms of model architecture, we adopt Swin Transformer Base as the backbone for satellite imagery, utilize the TabM network for tabular feature extraction, retain the Temporal Swin Transformer for time-series modeling, and employ a stackable serial tri-modal cross-attention mechanism to optimize the fusion of heterogeneous modalities. Furthermore, empirical analysis reveals significant geographic distribution shifts between PA training and test samples, and models trained by directly mixing PO and PA data tend to experience performance degradation due to label noise in PO data. To address this, we draw on the mixture-of-experts paradigm: test samples are partitioned according to their spatial proximity to PA samples, and different models trained on distinct datasets are used for inference and post-processing within each partition. Experiments on the GeoLifeCLEF 2025 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves superior predictive performance in scenarios with limited PA coverage and pronounced distribution shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f46\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684Presence-Absence\uff08PA\uff09\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4f46\u6807\u7b7e\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684Presence-Only\uff08PO\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u690d\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5728GeoLifeCLEF 2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u690d\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u504f\u501a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u3002PA\u6570\u636e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u6570\u91cf\u7a00\u5c11\uff1bPO\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u4f46\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u3002\u4e24\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52a3\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u5730\u7406\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u805a\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347PO\u6570\u636e\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u9065\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5730\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528Swin Transformer Base\u63d0\u53d6\u9065\u611f\u5f71\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\uff0cTabM\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u8868\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0cTemporal Swin Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5806\u53e0\u7684\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\uff1b3\uff09\u501f\u9274\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u6309\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5212\u5206\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3PO\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728GeoLifeCLEF 2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PA\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u6df7\u5408PA\u4e0ePO\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6613\u56e0PO\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u53ca\u5206\u533a\u63a8\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u690d\u7269\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

CASTE dynamically balances spatial and temporal relations by evaluating frame-level audio-visual agreement, ensuring that key information is captured from both preceding and subsequent frames under misalignment.

In this paradigm, increasing the number of tokens is a common approach to improving motion reconstruction quality, but more tokens make it more difficult for generative models to learn. To maintain high reconstruction quality while reducing generation complexity, we propose leveraging language to achieve efficient motion tokenization, which we term Language-Guided Tokenization (LG-Tok). LG-Tok aligns natural language with motion at the tokenization stage, yielding compact, high-level semantic representations. This approach not only strengthens both tokenization and detokenization but also simplifies the learning of generative models. Furthermore, existing tokenizers predominantly adopt convolutional architectures, whose local receptive fields struggle to support global language guidance. To this end, we propose a Transformer-based Tokenizer that leverages attention mechanisms to enable effective alignment between language and motion. Additionally, we design a language-drop scheme, in which language conditions are randomly removed during training, enabling the detokenizer to support language-free guidance during generation. On the HumanML3D and Motion-X generation benchmarks, LG-Tok achieves Top-1 scores of 0.542 and 0.582, outperforming state-of-the-art methods (MARDM: 0.500 and 0.528), and with FID scores of 0.057 and 0.088, respectively, versus 0.114 and 0.147.

Building on UGData, we propose UGE, a two-stage training strategy that progressively and stably aligns images, text, and spatial structures by combining instruction-guided contrastive learning with graph-based spatial encoding. We finally introduce UGBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate how spatially grounded embeddings support diverse urban understanding tasks -- including geolocation ranking, image retrieval, urban perception, and spatial grounding. We develop UGE on multiple state-of-the-art VLM backbones, including Qwen2-VL, Qwen2.5-VL, Phi-3-Vision, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral, and train fixed-dimensional spatial embeddings with LoRA tuning. UGE built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B backbone achieves up to 44% improvement in image retrieval and 30% in geolocation ranking on training cities, and over 30% and 22% gains respectively on held-out cities, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicit spatial grounding for spatially intensive urban tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UGData\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86UGE\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0eUGBench\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u73af\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u7f3a\u5c11\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u57ce\u5e02\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u57ce\u5e02\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UGData\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u8857\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u8bed\u5883\u63cf\u8ff0\u63d0\u4f9b\u5bf9\u9f50\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eUGData\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UGE\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u7a33\u5065\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u5f15\u5bfc \u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86UGBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7b49\u57ce\u5e02\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41VLM\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ecQwen2-VL\u7b49\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u8c03\u4f18\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "UGE\u57fa\u4e8eQwen2.5-VL-7B\u4e3b\u5e72\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5730\u7406\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6392\u540d\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u57ce\u5e02\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534744%\u300130%\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u57ce\u5e02\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u8d8530%\u548c\u8d8522%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u663e\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Building upon these developments, the thinking with images paradigm has emerged, enabling models to dynamically edit and re-encode visual information at each reasoning step, mirroring human visual processing.

This necessitates Process Reward Models (PRMs) for distinguishing positive and negative reasoning steps, yet existing benchmarks for PRMs are predominantly text-centric and lack comprehensive assessment under this paradigm. To address these gaps, this work introduces the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating PRMs under the thinking with images paradigm. Our main contributions are: (1) Through extensive analysis of reasoning trajectories and guided search experiments with PRMs, we define 7 fine-grained error types and demonstrate both the necessity for specialized PRMs and the potential for improvement. (2) We construct a comprehensive benchmark comprising 1,206 manually annotated thinking with images reasoning trajectories spanning 4 categories and 16 subcategories for fine-grained evaluation of PRMs. (3) Our experimental analysis reveals that current LVLMs fall short as effective PRMs, exhibiting limited capabilities in visual reasoning process evaluation with significant performance disparities across error types, positive evaluation bias, and sensitivity to reasoning step positions.

However, challenges persist in handling geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and scaling, particularly in complex scenes. Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations: (1) difficulty in achieving accurate geometric editing of object translation, rotation, and scaling; (2) inadequate modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects, leading to unrealistic results. To address these issues, we propose GeoEdit, a framework that leverages in-context generation through a diffusion transformer module, which integrates geometric transformations for precise object edits. Moreover, we introduce Effects-Sensitive Attention, which enhances the modeling of intricate lighting and shadow effects for improved realism. To further support training, we construct RS-Objects, a large-scale geometric editing dataset containing over 120,000 high-quality image pairs, enabling the model to learn precise geometric editing while generating realistic lighting and shadows.

We first identify one critical design choice that has been previously overlooked, which significantly impacts the performance of the LightGlue model. We then investigate the role of detectors and descriptors within the transformer-based matching framework, finding that detectors, rather than descriptors, are often the primary cause for performance difference. Finally, we propose a novel approach to fine-tune existing image matching models using keypoints from a diverse set of detectors, resulting in a universal, detector-agnostic model. When deployed as a zero-shot matcher for novel detectors, the resulting model achieves or exceeds the accuracy of models specifically trained for those features.

We present Vista, a novel framework for scene-aware streaming video QA that enables efficient and scalable reasoning over continuous video streams. The innovation of Vista can be summarized in three aspects: (1) scene-aware segmentation, where Vista dynamically clusters incoming frames into temporally and visually coherent scene units; (2) scene-aware compression, where each scene is compressed into a compact token representation and stored in GPU memory for efficient index-based retrieval, while full-resolution frames are offloaded to CPU memory; and (3) scene-aware recall, where relevant scenes are selectively recalled and reintegrated into the model input upon receiving a query, enabling both efficiency and completeness. Vista is model-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with a variety of vision-language backbones, enabling long-context reasoning without compromising latency or memory efficiency.

Current methods primarily focus on spatial-temporal modeling or independent frequency domain analysis, lacking a unified framework for joint optimization across spatial, temporal, and frequency domains. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage information from all domains simultaneously, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Additionally, in motion generation frameworks, motion-irrelevant cues caused by noise are often entangled with features that contribute positively to generation, thereby leading to motion distortion. To address these issues, we propose Tri-Domain Causal Text-to-Motion Generation (TriC-Motion), a novel diffusion-based framework integrating spatial-temporal-frequency-domain modeling with causal intervention. TriC-Motion includes three core modeling modules for domain-specific modeling, namely Temporal Motion Encoding, Spatial Topology Modeling, and Hybrid Frequency Analysis. After comprehensive modeling, a Score-guided Tri-domain Fusion module integrates valuable information from the triple domains, simultaneously ensuring temporal consistency, spatial topology, motion trends, and dynamics. Moreover, the Causality-based Counterfactual Motion Disentangler is meticulously designed to expose motion-irrelevant cues to eliminate noise, disentangling the real modeling contributions of each domain for superior generation.

We categorise gestures into four primary classes (Stop, Go, Thank & Greet, and No Gesture) and extract 76 static and dynamic features from normalised keypoints.

We demonstrate substantial accuracy degradation under cross-dataset evaluation due to mismatched visual conditions. To address this challenge, we construct synthetic illumination-augmented datasets by systematically varying light temperature and intensity, enabling controlled robustness analysis without additional labels.\n  We further evaluate cross-dataset transfer learning and domain generalization, with a focus on illumination-sensitive target categories such as apple-based classes.

Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fr\u00e9chet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08VFMs\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7535\u5b50\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\uff08EM\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VFMs\u5df2\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u4ee5\u7ebf\u7c92\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u73b0\u72b6\u53ca\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9009\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00EM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Lucchi++\u548cVNC\uff09\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u6d41\u884cVFMs\uff08DINOv2, DINOv3, OpenCLIP\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u8868\u73b0\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u201c\u51bb\u7ed3\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc+\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u5272\u5934\u201d\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528PCA\u3001Fr\u00e9chet\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u7ebf\u6027Probe\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u4e00EM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u54ea\u79cd\u7f51\u7edc\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u597d\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002\u4f46\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cLoRA\u4ea6\u4ec5\u6709\u5fae\u5f31\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2aEM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5408\u95f4\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4f46\u8868\u5f81\u4f9d\u65e7\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u3001\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "VFMs\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684EM\u56fe\u50cf\u8f7b\u91cf\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784EM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u989d\u5916\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose GeoFocus, a novel framework comprising two core modules. 1) Critical Local Perceptor, which automatically identifies and emphasizes critical local structure (e.g., angles, parallel lines, comparative distances) through thirteen theory-based perception templates, boosting critical local feature coverage by 61% compared to previous methods. 2) VertexLang, a compact topology formal language, encodes global figures through vertex coordinates and connectivity relations. By replacing bulky code-based encodings, VertexLang reduces global perception training time by 20% while improving topology recognition accuracy. When evaluated in Geo3K, GeoQA, and FormalGeo7K, GeoFocus achieves a 4.7% accuracy improvement over leading specialized models and demonstrates superior robustness in MATHVERSE under diverse visual conditions.

However, thermal imagery often exhibits low texture, low contrast, and high noise, complicating feature-based SLAM. In this work, we propose a sparse monocular graph-based SLAM system for thermal imagery that leverages general-purpose learned features -- the SuperPoint detector and LightGlue matcher, trained on large-scale visible-spectrum data to improve cross-domain generalization. To adapt these components to thermal data, we introduce a preprocessing pipeline to enhance input suitability and modify core SLAM modules to handle sparse and outlier-prone feature matches.

In this paper, we present an efficient learning-free 4D Gaussian segmentation framework that lifts video segmentation masks to 4D spaces, whose core is a two-stage iterative boundary refinement, TIBR4D. The first stage is an Iterative Gaussian Instance Tracing (IGIT) at the temporal segment level. It progressively refines Gaussian-to-instance probabilities through iterative tracing, and extracts corresponding Gaussian point clouds that better handle occlusions and preserve completeness of object structures compared to existing one-shot threshold-based methods. The second stage is a frame-wise Gaussian Rendering Range Control (RCC) via suppressing highly uncertain Gaussians near object boundaries while retaining their core contributions for more accurate boundaries. Furthermore, a temporal segmentation merging strategy is proposed for IGIT to balance identity consistency and dynamic awareness. Longer segments enforce stronger multi-frame constraints for stable identities, while shorter segments allow identity changes to be captured promptly. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D demonstrate that our method produces accurate object Gaussian point clouds with clearer boundaries and higher efficiency compared to SOTA methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u76844D\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u7269\u4f53\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fb9\u754c\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67094D\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u5206\u5272\u5728\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u906e\u6321\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u7528\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9608\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u4e22\u5931\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aTIBR4D\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u662fIGIT\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u5230\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5272\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b65\u662fRCC\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u5e27\u6291\u5236\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fb9\u754c\u9644\u8fd1\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9ad8\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u4fdd\u7559\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u65f6\u6bb5\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u53ca\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728HyperNeRF\u548cNeu3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u754c\u9650\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5206\u8fa8\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u4e91\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u60014D\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002"}}

This is a preprint version. The camera-ready version will be updated soon", "summary": "Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b0\u578b2D\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5GOT-Edit\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u4f9d\u8d56\u76ee\u6807\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u76842D\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e863D\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u3001\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u591a\u6216\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u663e\u8457\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65f6\u5929\u7136\u4f1a\u5229\u7528\u9690\u542b\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u53472D\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ffd\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53eb\u505aGOT-Edit\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57282D\u89c6\u9891\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u505a\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf2D\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cdnull-space\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u5230\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u534f\u540c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ffd\u8e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08GOT benchmarks\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cGOT-Edit\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u62e5\u6324\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "GOT-Edit\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u901a\u7528\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u4e862D\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e3D\u51e0\u4f55\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u548c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing methods typically rely on a single Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to model temporal deformations, and they often struggle to capture complex point motions and fine-grained dynamic details consistently over time, especially from sparse input views. Our approach, FLAG-4D, overcomes this by employing a dual-deformation network that dynamically warps a canonical set of 3D Gaussians over time into new positions and anisotropic shapes. This dual-deformation network consists of an Instantaneous Deformation Network (IDN) for modeling fine-grained, local deformations and a Global Motion Network (GMN) for capturing long-range dynamics, refined through mutual learning. To ensure these deformations are both accurate and temporally smooth, FLAG-4D incorporates dense motion features from a pretrained optical flow backbone. We fuse these motion cues from adjacent timeframes and use a deformation-guided attention mechanism to align this flow information with the current state of each evolving 3D Gaussian. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FLAG-4D achieves higher-fidelity and more temporally coherent reconstructions with finer detail preservation than state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLAG-4D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u5efa3D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f9d\u8d56MLP\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4e14\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u65b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFLAG-4D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u53d8\u5f62\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf93D\u9ad8\u65af\u57fa\u5143\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5efa\u3002\u8be5\u53cc\u7f51\u7edc\u5305\u62ec\u672c\u5730\u7cbe\u7ec6\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u53d8\u5f62\u7f51\u7edc\uff08IDN\uff09\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GMN\uff09\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u4e92\u76f8\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5149\u6d41\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u5e27\u95f4\u7684\u7a20\u5bc6\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5f62\u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u9f503D\u9ad8\u65af\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u6d41\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cFLAG-4D\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u8fd8\u539f\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e3b\u6d41\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FLAG-4D\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u662f\u52a8\u6001\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Reference-based methods offer a promising alternative by transferring the preset color of a reference image to a source image. However, these approaches often operate as novice learners, performing global color mappings derived from pixel-level statistics, without a true understanding of semantic context or human aesthetics. To address this issue, we propose SemiNFT, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based retouching framework that mirrors the trajectory of human artistic training: beginning with rigid imitation and evolving into intuitive creation. Specifically, SemiNFT is first taught with paired triplets to acquire basic structural preservation and color mapping skills, and then advanced to reinforcement learning (RL) on unpaired data to cultivate nuanced aesthetic perception. Crucially, during the RL stage, to prevent catastrophic forgetting of old skills, we design a hybrid online-offline reward mechanism that anchors aesthetic exploration with structural review. % experiments Extensive experiments show that SemiNFT not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard preset transfer benchmarks but also demonstrates remarkable intelligence in zero-shot tasks, such as black-and-white photo colorization and cross-domain (anime-to-photo) preset transfer. These results confirm that SemiNFT transcends simple statistical matching and achieves a sophisticated level of aesthetic comprehension.

Therefore, point cloud compression plays a crucial role in practical applications for both human and machine perception optimization. To this end, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) has established two standards for point cloud compression, including Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression (G-PCC) and Video-based Point Cloud Compression (V-PCC).

However, such semantic features often lack low-level information (\\eg, color and texture), leading to degraded reconstruction fidelity, which has emerged as a primary bottleneck in further scaling LDMs. To address this limitation, we propose LV-RAE, a representation autoencoder that augments semantic features with missing low-level information, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction while remaining highly aligned with the semantic distribution. We further observe that the resulting high-dimensional, information-rich latent make decoders sensitive to latent perturbations, causing severe artifacts when decoding generated latent and consequently degrading generation quality. Our analysis suggests that this sensitivity primarily stems from excessive decoder responses along directions off the data manifold. Building on these insights, we propose fine-tuning the decoder to increase its robustness and smoothing the generated latent via controlled noise injection, thereby enhancing generation quality. Experiments demonstrate that LV-RAE significantly improves reconstruction fidelity while preserving the semantic abstraction and achieving strong generative quality.

To capture both global and local features, a learnable [CLS] class token is typically prepended to the input sequence of patch tokens. Despite their distinct nature, both token types are processed identically throughout the model. In this work, we investigate the friction between global and local feature learning under different pre-training strategies by analyzing the interactions between class and patch tokens. Our analysis reveals that standard normalization layers introduce an implicit differentiation between these token types. Building on this insight, we propose specialized processing paths that selectively disentangle the computational flow of class and patch tokens, particularly within normalization layers and early query-key-value projections. This targeted specialization leads to significantly improved patch representation quality for dense prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate segmentation performance gains of over 2 mIoU points on standard benchmarks, while maintaining strong classification accuracy.

While WiFi-based methods have gained traction, they often struggle with continuous motion and high computational overhead. This work presents WiFlow, a novel framework for continuous human pose estimation using WiFi signals. Unlike vision-based approaches such as two-dimensional deep residual networks that treat Channel State Information (CSI) as images, WiFlow employs an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder captures spatio-temporal features of CSI using temporal and asymmetric convolutions, preserving the original sequential structure of signals. It then refines keypoint features of human bodies to be tracked and capture their structural dependencies via axial attention. The decoder subsequently maps the encoded high-dimensional features into keypoint coordinates. Trained on a self-collected dataset of 360,000 synchronized CSI-pose samples from 5 subjects performing continuous sequences of 8 daily activities, WiFlow achieves a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCK) of 97.00% at a threshold of 20% (PCK@20) and 99.48% at PCK@50, with a mean per-joint position error of 0.008m. With only 4.82M parameters, WiFlow significantly reduces model complexity and computational cost, establishing a new performance baseline for practical WiFi-based human pose estimation.

However, it still needs to be determined how to apply ML to areas with mathematical constraints, like solving PDEs. Among various approaches to applying ML techniques to solving PDEs, the data-driven discretization method presents a promising way of accelerating and improving existing PDE solver on structured grids where it predicts the coefficients of quasi-linear stencils for computing values or derivatives of a function at given positions. It can improve the accuracy and stability of low-resolution simulation compared with using traditional finite difference or finite volume schemes. Meanwhile, it can also benefit from traditional numerical schemes like achieving conservation law by adapting finite volume type formulations. In this thesis, we have implemented the shallow water equation and Euler equation classic solver under a different framework. Experiments show that our classic solver performs much better than the Pyclaw solver. Then we propose four different deep neural networks for the ML-based solver. The results indicate that two of these approaches could output satisfactory solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u7684PDE\uff08\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u62df\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u6d45\u6c34\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u6b27\u62c9\u65b9\u7a0b\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684ML\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8f83\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5df2\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u8ba9\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982PDE\u6c42\u89e3\uff09\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u662f\u96be\u70b9\u3002\u63d0\u5347\u4f20\u7edfPDE\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u52a8\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6d45\u6c34\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u6b27\u62c9\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u56db\u79cd\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u901a\u91cf\u6216\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u7684ML\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6a21\u62df\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5747\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u6216\u6709\u9650\u4f53\u79ef\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e0ePyclaw\u6570\u503c\u89e3\u7b97\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u89e3\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\u3002\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u4e24\u79cd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u6ee1\u610f\u7684PDE\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u4e0b\u4e3aPDE\u6c42\u89e3\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e92\u8865\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ec6\u8282\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present ALIVE, a generation model that adapts a pretrained Text-to-Video (T2V) model to Sora-style audio-video generation and animation. In particular, the model unlocks the Text-to-Video&Audio (T2VA) and Reference-to-Video&Audio (animation) capabilities compared to the T2V foundation models. To support the audio-visual synchronization and reference animation, we augment the popular MMDiT architecture with a joint audio-video branch which includes TA-CrossAttn for temporally-aligned cross-modal fusion and UniTemp-RoPE for precise audio-visual alignment. Meanwhile, a comprehensive data pipeline consisting of audio-video captioning, quality control, etc., is carefully designed to collect high-quality finetuning data. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to perform a comprehensive model test and comparison. After continue pretraining and finetuning on million-level high-quality data, ALIVE demonstrates outstanding performance, consistently outperforming open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions. With detailed recipes and benchmarks, we hope ALIVE helps the community develop audio-video generation models more efficiently.

Artificial general intelligence is, at its core, a compression problem. Effective compression demands resonance: deep learning scales best when its architecture aligns with the fundamental structure of the data. These are the fundamental principles. Yet, modern vision architectures have strayed from these truths: visual signals are highly redundant, while discriminative information, the surprise, is sparse. Current models process dense pixel grids uniformly, wasting vast compute on static background rather than focusing on the predictive residuals that define motion and meaning. We argue that to solve visual understanding, we must align our architectures with the information-theoretic principles of video, i.e., Codecs.\n  Method. OneVision-Encoder encodes video by compressing predictive visual structure into semantic meaning. By adopting Codec Patchification, OV-Encoder abandons uniform computation to focus exclusively on the 3.1%-25% of regions rich in signal entropy. To unify spatial and temporal reasoning under irregular token layouts, OneVision-Encoder employs a shared 3D RoPE and is trained with a large-scale cluster discrimination objective over more than one million semantic concepts, jointly capturing object permanence and motion dynamics.\n  Evidence. The results validate our core hypothesis: efficiency and accuracy are not a trade-off; they are positively correlated. When integrated into LLM, it consistently outperforms strong vision backbones such as Qwen3-ViT and SigLIP2 across 16 image, video, and document understanding benchmarks, despite using substantially fewer visual tokens and pretraining data.

In this paper, we present an innovative video decomposition strategy that incorporates view-independent and view-dependent components to enhance the performance of LLVE. The framework is called View-aware Low-light Video Enhancement (VLLVE). We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for the view-independent term (which primarily captures intrinsic appearance) and impose a scene-level continuity constraint on the view-dependent term (which mainly describes the shading condition) to achieve consistent and satisfactory decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a cross-frame interaction mechanism. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. Building upon VLLVE, we propose a more comprehensive decomposition strategy by introducing an additive residual term, resulting in VLLVE++. This residual term can simulate scene-adaptive degradations, which are difficult to model using a decomposition formulation for common scenes, thereby further enhancing the ability to capture the overall content of videos. In addition, VLLVE++ enables bidirectional learning for both enhancement and degradation-aware correspondence refinement (end-to-end manner), effectively increasing reliable correspondences while filtering out incorrect ones. Notably, VLLVE++ demonstrates strong capability in handling challenging cases, such as real-world scenes and videos with high dynamics.

Yet despite these gains, it remains unclear how language backbone representations adapt during multimodal training and when vision-specific capabilities emerge. In this work, we present the first mechanistic analysis of VLM adaptation. Using stage-wise model diffing, a technique that isolates representational changes introduced during multimodal fine-tuning, we reveal how a language model learns to \"see\". We first identify vision-preferring features that emerge or reorient during fine-tuning. We then show that a selective subset of these features reliably encodes spatial relations, revealed through controlled shifts to spatial prompts. Finally, we trace the causal activation of these features to a small group of attention heads. Our findings show that stage-wise model diffing reveals when and where spatially grounded multimodal features arise. It also provides a clearer view of modality fusion by showing how visual grounding reshapes features that were previously text-only.

Current solutions mainly use supervised learning, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we investigate whether body region detection in volumetric CT and MR images can be achieved in a fully zero-shot manner by using knowledge embedded in large pre-trained foundation models. We propose and systematically evaluate three training-free pipelines: (1) a segmentation-driven rule-based system leveraging pre-trained multi-organ segmentation models, (2) a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) guided by radiologist-defined rules, and (3) a segmentation-aware MLLM that combines visual input with explicit anatomical evidence. All methods are evaluated on 887 heterogeneous CT and MR scans with manually verified anatomical region labels. The segmentation-driven rule-based approach achieves the strongest and most consistent performance, with weighted F1-scores of 0.947 (CT) and 0.914 (MR), demonstrating robustness across modalities and atypical scan coverage.

It has wide applications like view synthesis, relighting, and scene editing. In recent years, inverse rendering methods have been inspired by view synthesis approaches like neural radiance fields and Gaussian splatting, which are capable of efficiently decomposing a scene into its geometry and radiance. They then further estimate the material and lighting that lead to the observed scene radiance. However, the latter step is highly ambiguous and prior works suffer from inaccurate color and baked shadows in their albedo estimation albeit their regularization. To this end, we propose RotLight, a simple capturing setup, to address the ambiguity. Compared to a usual capture, RotLight only requires the object to be rotated several times during the process. We show that as few as two rotations is effective in reducing artifacts. To further improve 2DGS-based inverse rendering, we additionally introduce a proxy mesh that not only allows accurate incident light tracing, but also enables a residual constraint and improves global illumination handling. We demonstrate with both synthetic and real world datasets that our method achieves superior albedo estimation while keeping efficient computation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRotLight\u7684\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6355\u6349\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u591a\u6b21\u65cb\u8f6c\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6750\u8d28\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53cd\u7167\u7387\uff09\u7684\u4f30\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u4f30\u7b97\u6548\u679c\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f30\u7b97\u7269\u4f53\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u65f6\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u989c\u8272\u4e0d\u51c6\u548c\u9634\u5f71\u70d8\u7119\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8e\u6750\u8d28\u548c\u5149\u7167\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8f83\u5927\u6b67\u4e49\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u7b80\u5316\u91c7\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6b67\u4e49\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u4f30\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RotLight\u91c7\u96c6\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5728\u6355\u6349\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u591a\u6b21\u65cb\u8f6c\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u4ec5\u9700\u4e24\u6b21\u65cb\u8f6c\u5373\u53ef\u89c1\u6548\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u6750\u8d28\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u57282D\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5165\u5c04\u5149\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ea6\u675f\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRotLight\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u4f30\u7b97\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RotLight\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u65cb\u8f6c\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u683c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u4f30\u7b97\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9006\u5411\u6e32\u67d3\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

First, editing and preserved regions are automatically identified by measuring semantic discrepancies between source and target prompts. To mitigate boundary artifacts, FusionEdit performs distance-aware latent fusion along region boundaries to yield the soft and accurate mask, and employs a total variation loss to enforce smooth transitions, obtaining natural editing results. Second, FusionEdit leverages AdaIN-based modulation within DiT attention layers to perform a statistical attention fusion in the editing region, enhancing editability while preserving global consistency with the source image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FusionEdit significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Accurate classification of these movements requires sensing technologies capable of capturing rapid dynamics without distortion. Event cameras, also known as Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), provide asynchronous recordings of changes in light intensity, thereby eliminating motion blur inherent in conventional frame-based cameras and offering superior temporal resolution and data efficiency. In this study, we introduce a synthetic dataset generated with Blender to simulate saccades and fixations under controlled conditions. Leveraging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), we evaluate its robustness by training two architectures and finetuning on real event data. The proposed models achieve up to 0.83 accuracy and maintain consistent performance across varying temporal resolutions, demonstrating stability in eye movement classification. Moreover, the use of SNNs with synthetic event streams yields substantial computational efficiency gains over artificial neural network (ANN) counterparts, underscoring the utility of synthetic data augmentation in advancing event-based vision.

Reducing these artifacts is critical for high-quality imaging. We propose a computationally efficient hybrid deep-learning framework that combines the strengths of 2D and 3D models. First, a 2D U-Net operates on individual slices of undersampled CT volumes to extract feature maps. These slice-wise feature maps are then stacked across the volume and used as input to a 3D decoder, which utilizes contextual information across slices to predict an artifact-free 3D CT volume. The proposed two-stage approach balances the computational efficiency of 2D processing with the volumetric consistency provided by 3D modeling. The results show substantial improvements in inter-slice consistency in coronal and sagittal direction with low computational overhead.

Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling inter-class confusion for effective source-free adaptation.

Cognitive studies suggest that humans address such tasks through two mechanisms: cross-view correspondence, which identifies regions across different views that correspond to the same physical locations, and stepwise viewpoint transformation, which composes relative viewpoint changes sequentially. However, existing studies incorporate these mechanisms only partially and often implicitly, without explicit supervision for both. We propose Human-Aware Training for Cross-view correspondence and viewpoint cHange (HATCH), a training framework with two complementary objectives: (1) Patch-Level Spatial Alignment, which encourages patch representations to align across views for spatially corresponding regions, and (2) Action-then-Answer Reasoning, which requires the model to generate explicit viewpoint transition actions before predicting the final answer. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that HATCH consistently outperforms baselines of comparable size by a clear margin and achieves competitive results against much larger models, while preserving single-image reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6HATCH\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8ba4\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f9d\u9760\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u5e94\u548c\u9010\u6b65\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u6362\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6b64\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHATCH\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff081\uff09Patch-Level Spatial Alignment\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\uff082\uff09Action-then-Answer Reasoning\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u56de\u7b54\u524d\uff0c\u5148\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cHATCH\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u540c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u660e\u663e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "HATCH\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u542f\u53d1\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, existing flow-based editors predominantly support global or single-instruction edits and struggle with multi-instance scenarios, where multiple parts of a reference input must be edited independently without semantic interference. We identify this limitation as a consequence of globally conditioned velocity fields and joint attention mechanisms, which entangle concurrent edits. To address this issue, we introduce Instance-Disentangled Attention, a mechanism that partitions joint attention operations, enforcing binding between instance-specific textual instructions and spatial regions during velocity field estimation. We evaluate our approach on both natural image editing and a newly introduced benchmark of text-dense infographics with region-level editing instructions.

However, the animation generation algorithms modeling human pose with 2D or 3D structures all face various problems, including low-quality output content and training data deficiency, preventing the related algorithms from generating high-quality animation videos. Therefore, we introduce MVAnimate, a novel framework that synthesizes both 2D and 3D information of dynamic figures based on multi-view prior information, to enhance the generated video quality.

However, many recent talking-head generation (THG) methods rely on GPU-centric neural rendering, large training sets, or high-capacity diffusion models, which limits deployment in offline or resource-constrained learning environments. A deterministic and CPU-oriented THG framework is described, termed Symbolic Vedic Computation, that converts speech to a time-aligned phoneme stream, maps phonemes to a compact viseme inventory, and produces smooth viseme trajectories through symbolic coarticulation inspired by Vedic sutra Urdhva Tiryakbhyam. A lightweight 2D renderer performs region-of-interest (ROI) warping and mouth compositing with stabilization to support real-time synthesis on commodity CPUs. Experiments report synchronization accuracy, temporal stability, and identity consistency under CPU-only execution, alongside benchmarking against representative CPU-feasible baselines. Results indicate that acceptable lip-sync quality can be achieved while substantially reducing computational load and latency, supporting practical educational avatars on low-end hardware.

However, electrical arcing at this interface poses serious risks, including accelerated wear of contact components, degraded system performance, and potential service disruptions. Detecting arcing events at the pantograph-catenary interface is challenging due to their transient nature, noisy operating environment, data scarcity, and the difficulty of distinguishing arcs from other similar transient phenomena. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multimodal framework that combines high-resolution image data with force measurements to more accurately and robustly detect arcing events. First, we construct two arcing detection datasets comprising synchronized visual and force measurements. One dataset is built from data provided by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), and the other is derived from publicly available videos of arcing events in different railway systems and synthetic force data that mimic the characteristics observed in the real dataset. Leveraging these datasets, we propose MultiDeepSAD, an extension of the DeepSAD algorithm for multiple modalities with a new loss formulation. Additionally, we introduce tailored pseudo-anomaly generation techniques specific to each data type, such as synthetic arc-like artifacts in images and simulated force irregularities, to augment training data and improve the discriminative ability of the model. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, exhibiting enhanced sensitivity to real arcing events even under domain shifts and limited availability of real arcing observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u4e3a\u7cbe\u51c6\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u7535\u6c14\u5316\u94c1\u8def\u53d7\u7535\u5f13-\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u754c\u9762\u7684\u7535\u5f27\u3002\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u7535\u5f13-\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u754c\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u7535\u5f27\u73b0\u8c61\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u8bbe\u5907\u78e8\u635f\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u751a\u81f3\u94c1\u8def\u8fd0\u8425\u4e2d\u65ad\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7535\u5f27\u4e8b\u4ef6\u77ac\u6001\u6027\u3001\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7535\u5f27\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u529b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\uff09\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5MultiDeepSAD\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u529b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u522b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4f2a\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u53ca\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7535\u5f27\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u8bc6\u522b\u94c1\u8def\u53d7\u7535\u5f13-\u63a5\u89e6\u7f51\u7535\u5f27\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u94c1\u8def\u4f9b\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u76d1\u63a7\u3002"}}

Current approaches to producing audio-visual content often rely on cascaded pipelines, which increase cost, accumulate errors, and degrade overall quality. While systems such as Veo 3 and Sora 2 emphasize the value of simultaneous generation, joint multimodal modeling introduces unique challenges in architecture, data, and training. Moreover, the closed-source nature of existing systems limits progress in the field. In this work, we introduce MOVA (MOSS Video and Audio), an open-source model capable of generating high-quality, synchronized audio-visual content, including realistic lip-synced speech, environment-aware sound effects, and content-aligned music.

We propose a semi-supervised teacher-student framework that combines an uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling teacher with a progressive, confidence-based curriculum for the student. The teacher produces probabilistic masks and per-pixel uncertainty; unlabeled scans are ranked by image-level confidence and introduced in stages, while a dual-loss objective trains the student to learn from high-confidence regions and unlearn low-confidence ones. Agreement-based refinement further improves pseudo-label quality. On BraTS 2021, validation DSC increased from 0.393 (10% data) to 0.872 (100%), with the largest gains in early stages, demonstrating data efficiency. The teacher reached a validation DSC of 0.922, and the student surpassed the teacher on tumor subregions (e.g., NCR/NET 0.797 and Edema 0.980); notably, the student recovered the Enhancing class (DSC 0.620) where the teacher failed.

In this way, the rich contextual representations from the understanding model are directly used to guide the generative process, thereby improving performance on complex and compositional editing. Moreover, a lightweight adapter is developed to inject multimodal conditional tokens into pretrained text-to-video diffusion models, allowing maximum reuse of their powerful generative priors in a parameter-efficient manner.

Traditional MRI synthesis methods are modality-specific, limited in anatomical adaptability, and lack clinical interpretability-failing to meet NPC's RT needs. Here, we developed a unified foundation model integrating contrastive visual representation learning and vision-language alignment (VLA) to enable any-to-all MRI synthesis. The model uses a contrastive encoder for modality-invariant representations and a CLIP-based text-informed decoder for semantically consistent synthesis, supporting any-to-all MRI synthesis via one unified foundation model.

Specifically, rather than directly optimizing for detection task, we adopt general spatiotemporal grounding and self-supervised object counting in the RL stage, enhancing detection performance with simple perception pretext tasks. To facilitate robust evaluation, we further introduce MintVid, a light yet high-quality dataset containing 3K videos from 9 state-of-the-art generators, along with a real-world collected subset that has factual errors in content.

However, current ways of entire-block pruning suffer from risks of discarding meaningful cues learned in those blocks, leading to substantial performance degradation. As another line of model compression, channel pruning can better preserve performance, while it cannot reduce model depth and is challenged by inconsistent pruning ratios for individual layers. To pursue better model compression and acceleration, this paper proposes \\textbf{FlattenGPT}, a novel way to detect and reduce depth-wise redundancies. By flatting two adjacent blocks into one, it compresses the network depth, meanwhile enables more effective parameter redundancy detection and removal. FlattenGPT allows to preserve the knowledge learned in all blocks, and remains consistent with the original transformer architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlattenGPT enhances model efficiency with a decent trade-off to performance. It outperforms existing pruning methods in both zero-shot accuracies and WikiText-2 perplexity across various model types and parameter sizes. On LLaMA-2/3 and Qwen-1.5 models, FlattenGPT retains 90-96\\% of zero-shot performance with a compression ratio of 20\\%.

However, Video MLLMs face high computational costs, particularly in processing numerous video frames as input, which leads to significant attention computation overhead. A straightforward approach to reduce computational costs is to decrease the number of input video frames. However, simply selecting key frames at a fixed frame rate (FPS) often overlooks valuable information in non-key frames, resulting in notable performance degradation. To address this, we propose Text-guided Video Frame Reduction (TiFRe), a framework that reduces input frames while preserving essential video information. TiFRe uses a Text-guided Frame Sampling (TFS) strategy to select key frames based on user input, which is processed by an LLM to generate a CLIP-style prompt. Pre-trained CLIP encoders calculate the semantic similarity between the prompt and each frame, selecting the most relevant frames as key frames.

We term these Rendering-Optimal References (RORs) and analyze their statistical properties, revealing stable patterns: mixture-structured scales and bimodal radiance across diverse scenes. To understand what determines these parameters, we apply learnability probes by training predictors to reconstruct RORs from point clouds without rendering supervision. Our analysis uncovers fundamental density-stratification. Dense regions exhibit geometry-correlated parameters amenable to render-free prediction, while sparse regions show systematic failure across architectures. We formalize this through variance decomposition, demonstrating that visibility heterogeneity creates covariance-dominated coupling between geometric and appearance parameters in sparse regions. This reveals the dual character of RORs: geometric primitives where point clouds suffice, and view synthesis primitives where multi-view constraints are essential.

Recent motion modeling techniques are ill-suited to this problem setting. For example, deformation fields cannot introduce new geometry, and 4D Gaussian splatting constrains motion to a linear trajectory in space and time and cannot track the same set of Gaussians over time. Here, we introduce a 3D Gaussian flow field representation that models plant growth as a time-varying derivative over Gaussian parameters -- position, scale, orientation, color, and opacity -- enabling nonlinear and continuous-time growth dynamics. To initialize a sufficient set of Gaussian primitives, we reconstruct the mature plant and learn a process of reverse growth, effectively simulating the plant's developmental history in reverse.

The core of our method is a novel joint representation of dense 3D point maps and 3D scene flows in a shared coordinate system, and a novel 4D VAE to effectively learn this representation. Unlike prior work that forces the 3D value and latents to align strictly with RGB VAE latents-despite their fundamentally different distributions-we show that such alignment is unnecessary and leads to suboptimal performance. Instead, we introduce a new data normalization and VAE training strategy that better transfers diffusion priors and greatly improves reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that MotionCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in both geometry reconstruction and dense scene flow estimation, delivering 38.64% and 25.0% improvements in geometry and motion reconstruction, respectively, all without any post-optimization.

This limitation is evident from the poor generalization to sports unseen during finetuning. Furthermore, traditional text generation evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU-4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, BERTScore), originally developed for machine translation and summarization, fail to capture the unique aspects of sports feedback quality. To address the first problem, using rock climbing as our case study, we propose using auxiliary freely-available web data from the target domain, such as competition videos and coaching manuals, in addition to existing sports feedback from a disjoint, source domain to improve sports feedback generation performance on the target domain. To improve evaluation, we propose two evaluation metrics: (1) specificity and (2) actionability.

However, existing distillation methods typically approximate the teacher trajectory by using linear shortcuts, which makes it difficult to match its constantly changing tangent directions as velocities evolve across timesteps, thereby leading to quality degradation. To address this limitation, we propose ArcFlow, a few-step distillation framework that explicitly employs non-linear flow trajectories to approximate pre-trained teacher trajectories. Concretely, ArcFlow parameterizes the velocity field underlying the inference trajectory as a mixture of continuous momentum processes. This enables ArcFlow to capture velocity evolution and extrapolate coherent velocities to form a continuous non-linear trajectory within each denoising step. Importantly, this parameterization admits an analytical integration of this non-linear trajectory, which circumvents numerical discretization errors and results in high-precision approximation of the teacher trajectory. To train this parameterization into a few-step generator, we implement ArcFlow via trajectory distillation on pre-trained teacher models using lightweight adapters. This strategy ensures fast, stable convergence while preserving generative diversity and quality. Built on large-scale models (Qwen-Image-20B and FLUX.1-dev), ArcFlow only fine-tunes on less than 5% of original parameters and achieves a 40x speedup with 2 NFEs over the original multi-step teachers without significant quality degradation.

However, existing techniques struggle in faithfully generating the structure and semantics conveyed by complex floorplans that depict large indoor spaces with many rooms and a varying numbers of polygon corners. To this end, we propose Raster2Seq, framing floorplan reconstruction as a sequence-to-sequence task in which floorplan elements--such as rooms, windows, and doors--are represented as labeled polygon sequences that jointly encode geometry and semantics. Our approach introduces an autoregressive decoder that learns to predict the next corner conditioned on image features and previously generated corners using guidance from learnable anchors. These anchors represent spatial coordinates in image space, hence allowing for effectively directing the attention mechanism to focus on informative image regions. By embracing the autoregressive mechanism, our method offers flexibility in the output format, enabling for efficiently handling complex floorplans with numerous rooms and diverse polygon structures.

We systematically investigate the performance gap between discrete and continuous methods. Contrary to the belief that discrete tokenizers are intrinsically inferior, we demonstrate that the disparity arises primarily from the total number of bits allocated in the latent space (i.e., the compression ratio). We show that scaling up the codebook size effectively bridges this gap, allowing discrete tokenizers to match or surpass their continuous counterparts. However, existing discrete generation methods struggle to capitalize on this insight, suffering from performance degradation or prohibitive training costs with scaled codebook. To address this, we propose masked Bit AutoRegressive modeling (BAR), a scalable framework that supports arbitrary codebook sizes. By equipping an autoregressive transformer with a masked bit modeling head, BAR predicts discrete tokens through progressively generating their constituent bits. BAR achieves a new state-of-the-art gFID of 0.99 on ImageNet-256, outperforming leading methods across both continuous and discrete paradigms, while significantly reducing sampling costs and converging faster than prior continuous approaches.
