However, such paradigm shift introduces critical security vulnerabilities stemming from the ''embodiment gap'', a discord between the LLM's abstract reasoning and the physical, context-dependent nature of robotics. While security for text-based LLMs is an active area of research, existing solutions are often insufficient to address the unique threats for the embodied robotic agents, where malicious outputs manifest not merely as harmful text but as dangerous physical actions. In this work, we present a systematic survey, summarizing the emerging threat landscape and corresponding defense strategies for LLM-controlled robotics. Specifically, we discuss a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors, covering topics such as jailbreaking, backdoor attacks, and multi-modal prompt injection. In response, we analyze and categorize a range of defense mechanisms, from formal safety specifications and runtime enforcement to multi-LLM oversight and prompt hardening. Furthermore, we review key datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate the robustness of these embodied systems. By synthesizing current research, this work highlights the urgent need for context-aware security solutions and provides a foundational roadmap for the development of safe, secure, and reliable LLM-controlled robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0e\u9632\u5fa1\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u4f53\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLM\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u7406\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u201cembodiment gap\u201d\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672cLLM\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u7d27\u8feb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u5c55\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u6587\u732e\u8c03\u7814\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0eLLM\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u5411\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u8d8a\u72f1\u3001\u540e\u95e8\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u68b3\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f3a\u5236\u3001\u591aLLM\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u52a0\u56fa\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u6574\u7406\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u73b0\u72b6\u53ca\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u591a\u4e3a\u521d\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u4e14\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e3aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53d1\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5b89\u5168\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002"}}

Traditional physical world models (PWM) focus on quantifiable physical attributes such as space and motion, failing to meet the needs of social intelligence modeling. In contrast, the Mental World Model (MWM), as a structured representation of humans' internal mental states, has become the critical cognitive foundation for embodied agents to achieve natural human-machine collaboration and dynamic social adaptation. However, current MWM research faces significant bottlenecks: such as fragmented conceptual framework with vague boundaries between MWM and PWM, disjointed reasoning mechanisms for the technical pathways and applicable scenarios of different Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning paradigms, and detachment between evaluation and practice.\n  To address these issues, this review systematically synthesizes over 100 authoritative studies to provide a comprehensive overview of MWM research for embodied AI. Its core contributions are threefold: First, it constructs a complete theoretical framework for MWM for the first time. Specifically, it distinguishes the essential differences between MWM and PWMs. Second, it systematically defines the key components of MWM through two paradigms for mental element representation. Third, it comprehensively analyzes two core ToM reasoning paradigms with 19 ToM methods. Finally, it also clarifies the integration trend of neuro-symbolic hybrid architectures, and synthesizes 26 ToM evaluation benchmarks.

This observation has led researchers towards identifying elementary building blocks of motion known as movement primitives, which are well-suited for generating motor commands in autonomous systems, such as robots. In this survey, we provide an encyclopedic overview of movement primitive approaches and applications in chronological order. Concretely, we present movement primitive frameworks as a way of representing robotic control trajectories acquired through human demonstrations. Within the area of robotics, movement primitives can encode basic motions at the trajectory level, such as how a robot would grasp a cup or the sequence of motions necessary to toss a ball. Furthermore, movement primitives have been developed with the desirable analytical properties of a spring-damper system, probabilistic coupling of multiple demonstrations, using neural networks in high-dimensional systems, and more, to address difficult challenges in robotics. Although movement primitives have widespread application to a variety of fields, the goal of this survey is to inform practitioners on the use of these frameworks in the context of robotics.

These components interact seamlessly through a unified masked self-attention mechanism. Building upon InternVL3 and Qwen3-VL, we instantiate InternVLA-A1 at 2B and 3B parameter scales. We pre-train these models on hybrid synthetic-real datasets spanning InternData-A1 and Agibot-World, covering over 533M frames. This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 across 12 real-world robotic tasks and simulation benchmark. It significantly outperforms leading models like pi0 and GR00T N1.5, achieving a 14.5\\% improvement in daily tasks and a 40\\%-73.3\\% boost in dynamic settings, such as conveyor belt sorting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578bInternVLA-A1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u572812\u9879\u73b0\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u800c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4fa7\u91cd\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5374\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u5b9a\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u7814\u53d1\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u80fd\u529b\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "InternVLA-A1\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684Mixture-of-Transformers\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u524d\u77bb\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u673a\u5236\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u57282B\u548c3B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6db5\u76d6533M\u5e27\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u9879\u73b0\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cInternVLA-A1\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8f83\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u534714.5%\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u534740%~73.3%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8epi0\u548cGR00T N1.5\u7b49\u524d\u6cbf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "InternVLA-A1\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5177\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks largely overlook these complexities, focusing instead on clean or generic conversational audio. To bridge this gap, we present WearVox, the first benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate voice assistants in realistic wearable scenarios. WearVox comprises 3,842 multi-channel, egocentric audio recordings collected via AI glasses across five diverse tasks including Search-Grounded QA, Closed-Book QA, Side-Talk Rejection, Tool Calling, and Speech Translation, spanning a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments and acoustic conditions. Each recording is accompanied by rich metadata, enabling nuanced analysis of model performance under real-world constraints. We benchmark leading proprietary and open-source speech Large Language Models (SLLMs) and find that most real-time SLLMs achieve accuracies on WearVox ranging from 29% to 59%, with substantial performance degradation on noisy outdoor audio, underscoring the difficulty and realism of the benchmark. Additionally, we conduct a case study with two new SLLMs that perform inference with single-channel and multi-channel audio, demonstrating that multi-channel audio inputs significantly enhance model robustness to environmental noise and improve discrimination between device-directed and background speech.

We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u7c7b\u65b0\u95ee\u9898STEAM\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5E-ITAGS\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u914d\u7f6e\u7ee9\u6548\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u5404\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4e0a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u6210\u8d25\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faSTEAM\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ee5'\u80fd\u529b\u7279\u5f81-\u7ee9\u6548\u6620\u5c04'\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u5143\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165E-ITAGS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b-\u7ee9\u6548\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cE-ITAGS\u5206\u914d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7ee9\u6548\u8d85\u8d8a\u591a\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5b88\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5176\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660eSTEAM\u548cE-ITAGS\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u7ee9\u6548\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Among these, software development is one of the key areas where LLMs are increasingly adopted. However, when hardware constraints are considered-for instance, in physical computing, where software must interact with and control physical hardware -their effectiveness has not been fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce \\textsc{PCEval} (Physical Computing Evaluation), the first benchmark in physical computing that enables a fully automatic evaluation of the capabilities of LLM in both the logical and physical aspects of the projects, without requiring human assessment. Our evaluation framework assesses LLMs in generating circuits and producing compatible code across varying levels of project complexity. Through comprehensive testing of 13 leading models, \\textsc{PCEval} provides the first reproducible and automatically validated empirical assessment of LLMs' ability to reason about fundamental hardware implementation constraints within a simulation environment. Our findings reveal that while LLMs perform well in code generation and logical circuit design, they struggle significantly with physical breadboard layout creation, particularly in managing proper pin connections and avoiding circuit errors. \\textsc{PCEval} advances our understanding of AI assistance in hardware-dependent computing environments and establishes a foundation for developing more effective tools to support physical computing education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u2014\u2014PCEval\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLMs\u64c5\u957f\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5e03\u5c40\u65b9\u9762\u8fd8\u6709\u660e\u663e\u77ed\u677f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4ef7LLMs\u5728\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PCEval\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u987b\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5LLMs\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7535\u8def\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u53ef\u517c\u5bb9\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u4e8613\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u591a\u6570LLMs\u5728\u751f\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9762\u5305\u677f\u7269\u7406\u5e03\u5c40\uff08\u5982\u9488\u811a\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u907f\u514d\u7535\u8def\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u65f6\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u5176\u5bf9\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ec6\u8282\u628a\u63a7\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684PCEval\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63d0\u5347AI\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u76f8\u5173\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\u7684\u534f\u52a9\u80fd\u529b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

On the BraTS (MRI), VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray) datasets, we achieve accuracies of 92\\%, 76\\%, and 62\\%, respectively, consistently outperforming non-guided baselines across all datasets.

A key assumption in these works is that the goal region is reachable; an assumption that often fails in practice when environments are disconnected. Motivated by this limitation, we consider known 3D environments comprising objects, also called blocks, that form distinct navigable support surfaces (planes), and that are either non-movable (e.g., tables) or movable (e.g., boxes). These surfaces may be mutually disconnected due to height differences, holes, or lateral separations. Our focus is on tasks where the robot must reach a goal region residing on an elevated plane that is unreachable. Rather than declaring such tasks infeasible, an effective strategy is to enable the robot to interact with the environment, rearranging movable objects to create new traversable connections; a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). Existing NAMO planners typically address 2D environments, where obstacles are pushed aside to clear a path. These methods cannot directly handle the considered 3D setting; in such cases, obstacles must be placed strategically to bridge these physical disconnections. We address this challenge by developing BRiDGE (Block-based Reconfiguration in Disconnected 3D Geometric Environments), a sampling-based planner that incrementally builds trees over robot and object configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which objects to move, where to place them, and in what order, while accounting for a limited number of movable objects. To accelerate planning, we introduce non-uniform sampling strategies. We show that our method is probabilistically complete and we provide extensive numerical and hardware experiments validating its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BRiDGE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf93D\u65ad\u5f00\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf2D/NAMO\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u8fbe\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u65ad\u5f00\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fbe\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u5230\u8fbe\u9ad8\u51fa\u7b49\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8fbe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BRiDGE\uff08Block-based Reconfiguration in Disconnected 3D Geometric Environments\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u9488\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u589e\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u6811\u72b6\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u5982\u4f55\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u54ea\u4e9b\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u653e\u5728\u54ea\uff0c\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u901a\u8def\u3002\u89c4\u5212\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6982\u7387\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u7269\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BRiDGE\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u7269\u4f53\u6765\u514b\u670d\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86NAMO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u96453D\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Building on RECIPE-NLG, we investigate the use of several composite objectives and present a new topological loss that represents ingredient lists as point clouds in embedding space, minimizing the divergence between predicted and gold ingredients. Using both standard NLG metrics and recipe-specific metrics, we find that our loss significantly improves ingredient- and action-level metrics. Meanwhile, the Dice loss excels in time/temperature precision, and the mixed loss yields competitive trade-offs with synergistic gains in quantity and time.

While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown strong performance, it often fails to adapt to real-world short-term distribution shifts, which arise as different batches of goods arrive sequentially, causing performance drops. We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it.

While Best-of-N and self-consistency methods show that aggregating multiple generations can improve performance, existing approaches typically rely on external evaluators, reward models, or exact string-match voting, limiting their applicability and efficiency. We propose Mode Extraction (ModeX), an evaluator-free Best-of-N selection framework that generalizes majority voting to open-ended text generation by identifying the modal output representing the dominant semantic consensus among generated texts. ModeX constructs a similarity graph over candidate generations and recursively applies spectral clustering to select a representative centroid, without requiring additional inference or auxiliary models. We further instantiate this selection principle as ModeX--Lite, an improved version of ModeX with early pruning for efficiency. Across open-ended tasks--including text summarization, code generation, and mathematical reasoning--our approaches consistently outperform standard single- and multi-path baselines, providing a computationally efficient solution for robust open-ended text generation.

Accurately recognizing human emotional states is crucial for facilitating smooth communication between humans and machines. Despite some progress in multimodal sentiment analysis research, numerous challenges remain. The first challenge is the limited and insufficiently rich features extracted from single modality data. Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information. This approach promotes the exchange of useful information between modalities, thereby strengthening inter-modal interactions. Furthermore, we integrate intra-modal features and inter-modal fused features, fully leveraging the complementarity of inter-modal feature information while considering feature information differences.

Traditional safety frameworks treat contact as unsafe, restricting robots to collision avoidance and limiting their ability to function in dense, everyday settings. As the number of objects grows, model-based approaches for safe manipulation become computationally intractable; meanwhile, learned methods typically tie safety to the task at hand, making them hard to transfer to new tasks without retraining. In this work we introduce Dense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF). Our approach bypasses the computational complexity of explicitly modeling multi-object dynamics by instead learning a composable, object-centric function that implicitly captures the safety constraints arising from physical interactions. Trained offline on interactions with a few objects, the learned DCBFcomposes across arbitrary object sets at runtime, producing a single global safety filter that scales linearly and transfers across tasks without retraining. We validate our approach through simulated experiments in dense clutter, demonstrating its ability to enable collision-free navigation and safe, contact-rich interaction in suitable settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDense Contact Barrier Functions\uff08DCBF\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u7269\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u8bad\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ea\u80fd\u907f\u78b0\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u65e5\u5e38\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7075\u6d3b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u5bf9\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDCBF\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u7269\u4f53\u3002\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u8bad\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DCBF\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing dynamic-depth and layer-skipping methods reduce this cost, but often rely on auxiliary routing mechanisms or incur accuracy degradation when bypassed layers are left uncompensated. We present \\textbf{LoRA-Drop}, a plug-and-play inference framework that accelerates decoding by applying a \\emph{temporal compute schedule} to a fixed subset of intermediate layers: on most decoding steps, selected layers reuse the previous-token hidden state and apply a low-rank LoRA correction, while periodic \\emph{refresh} steps execute the full model to prevent drift. LoRA-Drop requires no routing network, is compatible with standard KV caching, and can reduce KV-cache footprint by skipping KV updates in droppable layers during LoRA steps and refreshing periodically. Across \\textbf{LLaMA2-7B}, \\textbf{LLaMA3-8B}, \\textbf{Qwen2.5-7B}, and \\textbf{Qwen2.5-14B}, LoRA-Drop achieves up to \\textbf{2.6$\\times$ faster decoding} and \\textbf{45--55\\% KV-cache reduction} while staying within \\textbf{0.5 percentage points (pp)} of baseline accuracy. Evaluations on reasoning (GSM8K, MATH, BBH), code generation (HumanEval, MBPP), and long-context/multilingual benchmarks (LongBench, XNLI, XCOPA) identify a consistent \\emph{safe zone} of scheduling configurations that preserves quality while delivering substantial efficiency gains, providing a simple path toward adaptive-capacity inference in LLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/hosseinbv/LoRA-Drop.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLoRA-Drop\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u635f\u5931\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4eKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9010\u6b65\u3001\u5c42\u5c42\u6267\u884c\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u5c42\u8df3\u8fc7\u7b49\u65b9\u6848\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8df3\u8fc7\u5c42\u540e\u96be\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u4e14\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86LoRA-Drop\uff1a\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u89e3\u7801\u6b65\u53ea\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u590d\u7528\u524d\u4e00\u65f6\u523b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u52a0\u4e0a\u4f4e\u79e9LoRA\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5076\u5c14\u6267\u884c\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u201c\u5237\u65b0\u201d\u6b65\u6765\u4fee\u6b63\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8def\u7531\u7f51\u7edc\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6807\u51c6KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5bf9\u8df3\u8fc7\u5c42\u65f6\u53ef\u7701\u7565KV\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u7f13\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u8c03\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u517c\u5bb9\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA2-7B\u3001LLaMA3-8B\u3001Qwen2.5-7B\u548cQwen2.5-14B\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cLoRA-Drop\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u9ad82.6\u500d\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u901f\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u51cf\u5c1145-55%\uff0c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u635f\u5931\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc70.5\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u6279\u80fd\u517c\u987e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u201c\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u95f4\u201d\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRA-Drop\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u8def\u7531\u3001\u66f4\u6613\u843d\u5730\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u6539\u5584\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\uff0c\u662f\u63a8\u8fdb\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, none of these manipulators share exactly the same structure, as the order of joints and the ratio of link lengths differ among robots.

While fact-checking can mitigate these errors, existing methods typically retrieve external evidence indiscriminately, overlooking the model's internal knowledge and potentially introducing irrelevant noise. Moreover, current systems lack targeted mechanisms to resolve specific uncertainties in the model's reasoning. Inspired by how humans fact-check, we argue that LLMs should adaptively decide whether to rely on internal knowledge or initiate retrieval based on their confidence in a given claim. We introduce Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency (PCC), a framework that estimates factual confidence by jointly modeling an LLM's probabilistic certainty and reasoning consistency. These confidence signals enable an adaptive verification strategy: the model answers directly when confident, triggers targeted retrieval when uncertain or inconsistent, and escalates to deep search when ambiguity is high. Our confidence-guided routing mechanism ensures that retrieval is invoked only when necessary, improving both efficiency and reliability. Extensive experiments across three challenging benchmarks show that PCC achieves better uncertainty quantification than verbalized confidence and consistently outperforms strong LLM-based fact-checking baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PCC generalizes well across various LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPCC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u5730\u68c0\u7d22\u5916\u90e8\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u9020\u6210\u566a\u97f3\u8fc7\u591a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5e94\u5bf9\u5177\u4f53\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Probabilistic Certainty and Consistency\uff08PCC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u6982\u7387\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e2a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u81ea\u4fe1\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4fe1\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u7b54\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6216\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\u542f\u52a8\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cPCC\u6bd4\u53e3\u5934\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8868\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u62e5\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u529bLLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0cPCC\u5728\u591a\u79cdLLM\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PCC\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6838\u67e5\uff0c\u53ea\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u8c03\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6838\u67e5\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Here we introduce DataParasite, an open-source, modular pipeline for scalable online data collection. DataParasite decomposes tabular curation tasks into independent, entity-level searches defined through lightweight configuration files and executed through a shared, task-agnostic python script. Crucially, the same pipeline can be repurposed to new tasks, including those without predefined entity lists, using only natural-language instructions. We evaluate the pipeline on multiple canonical tasks in computational social science, including faculty hiring histories, elite death events, and political career trajectories. Across tasks, DataParasite achieves high accuracy while reducing data-collection costs by an order of magnitude relative to manual curation. By lowering the technical and labor barriers to online data assembly, DataParasite provides a practical foundation for scalable, transparent, and reusable data curation in computational social science and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aDataParasite\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u7f51\u7edc\u83b7\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u6574\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u5728\u7ebf\u6e20\u9053\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u5e38\u8d39\u65f6\u3001\u8d39\u529b\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u591f\u900f\u660e\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u5bf9\u79d1\u7814\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u4e0d\u592a\u5408\u9002\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDataParasite\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c06\u8868\u683c\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u8f7b\u677e\u914d\u7f6e\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u7528Python\u811a\u672c\u6267\u884c\u5b9e\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u62bd\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u6559\u5e08\u8058\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u3001\u7cbe\u82f1\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3001\u653f\u6cbb\u751f\u6daf\u8def\u7ebf\u7b49\uff0cDataParasite\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4eba\u5de5\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "DataParasite\u6781\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u4eba\u529b\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u793e\u4f1a\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTAP-ViTs\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u987b\u8bbf\u95ee\u539f\u59cb\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u3001\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u88c1\u526aViT\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7GMM\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dViT\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u914d\u6bcf\u53f0\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u6c42\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdd\u80cc\u9690\u79c1\u539f\u5219\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u66b4\u9732\u672c\u5730\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u53f0\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9a\u5236\u88c1\u526aViT\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faTAP-ViTs\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6bcf\u53f0\u8bbe\u5907\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b(GMM)\u62df\u5408\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u4e0a\u4f20GMM\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e0a\u4f20\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4e91\u7aef\u636e\u6b64\u4ece\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee3\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u548c\u5c42\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u7684ViT\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aViT\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cTAP-ViTs\u5728\u76f8\u4f3c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u76ee\u524d\u6700\u597d\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TAP-ViTs\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684ViT\u88c1\u526a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8ViT\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u7ec8\u7aef\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

As a result, tracking aggressive trajectories accurately could be challenging due to the existence of residual physics during controller synthesis. This paper presents a self-supervised residual learning and trajectory optimization framework to address the aforementioned challenges. At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized. It ends up with trajectories that are friendly to the following control level. The agile flight of quadrotors illustrates that by utilizing the hybrid dynamics, the proposed optimizer outputs aggressive motions that can be precisely tracked.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6267\u884c\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u6790\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u5f88\u96be\u8986\u76d6\u5168\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6fc0\u8fdb\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6b8b\u4f59\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6548\u5e94\u672a\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6b8b\u5dee\uff0c\u4e0e\u540d\u4e49\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5229\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u51ed\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u79ef\u5206\u6b65\u957f\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u6cbf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6b8b\u4f59\u7269\u7406\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5229\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u654f\u6377\u98de\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u7cbe\u51c6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6b8b\u5dee\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Leveraging the Qwen-3 dense model series and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we train models to generate responses to multiple choice questions conditioned on discrete ability descriptors. We reconstruct the probability of a correct response as a function of student ability, effectively generating synthetic Item Characteristic Curves (ICCs) to estimate IRT parameters.

This work is under review", "summary": "Textual reasoning has recently been widely adopted in Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA). However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization.

Existing meta-learning-based approaches require a shared representation of environmental structures, which lack flexibility for realistic non-structural disturbances. Besides, representation error and the distribution shifts can lead to heavy degradation in prediction accuracy. This work presents a generalizable disturbance estimation framework that builds on meta-learning and feedback-calibrated online adaptation. By extracting features from a finite time window of past observations, a unified representation that effectively captures general non-structural disturbances can be learned without predefined structural assumptions. The online adaptation process is subsequently calibrated by a state-feedback mechanism to attenuate the learning residual originating from the representation and generalizability limitations. Theoretical analysis shows that simultaneous convergence of both the online learning error and the disturbance estimation error can be achieved. Through the unified meta-representation, our framework effectively estimates multiple rapidly changing disturbances, as demonstrated by quadrotor flight experiments.

We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty. We recommend prioritizing vision encoder optimization and careful dataset curation when developing clinically applicable systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4e0e\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u80fd\u529b\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5355\u72ec\u7528\u4e8e\u819d\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574MLLM\uff0c\u4e14LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u5e76\u65e0\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u5747\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5931\u8861\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u66f4\u5e94\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u819d\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u5f71\u54cd\u5168\u74033-4\u4ebf\u4eba\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7406\u89e3MLLM\u5728\u6b64\u91cd\u8981\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cMLLM\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u5668\u3001LLM\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5404\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u5b8c\u6574MLLM\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7b49\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u819d\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708e\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u7684MLLM\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0cLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u91c7\u7528500\u5f20\u7c7b\u522b\u5747\u8861\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u75285,778\u5f20\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "MLLM\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u9ad8\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u75be\u75c5\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9c\u505a\u4e3b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u62a5\u544a\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5747\u8861\u4e3a\u9996\u8981\u3002"}}

This work presents a novel multi-modal EPW control system designed to prioritize patient needs while allowing seamless switching between control modes. Four complementary interfaces, namely joystick, speech, hand gesture, and electrooculography (EOG), are integrated with a continuous vital sign monitoring framework measuring heart rate variability, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and skin temperature. This combination enables greater patient independence while allowing caregivers to maintain real-time supervision and early intervention capability.\n  Two-point calibration of the biophysical sensors against clinical reference devices resulted in root mean square errors of at most 2 bpm for heart rate, 0.5 degree Celsius for skin temperature, and 1 percent for SpO2. Experimental evaluation involved twenty participants with mobility impairments executing a total of 500 indoor navigation commands. The achieved command recognition accuracies were 99 percent for joystick control, 97 percent plus or minus 2 percent for speech, and 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent for hand gesture, with an average closed-loop latency of 20 plus or minus 0.5 milliseconds. Caregivers receive real-time alerts through an Android application following encrypted cloud transmission of physiological data. By integrating multi-modal mobility control with cloud-enabled health monitoring and reporting latency and energy budgets, the proposed prototype addresses key challenges in assistive robotics, contributes toward compliance with ISO 7176-31 and IEC 80601-2-78 safety standards, and establishes a foundation for future adaptive machine learning enhancements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u52a8\u8f6e\u6905\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6b8b\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7535\u52a8\u8f6e\u6905\u867d\u4e3a\u8fd0\u52a8\u969c\u788d\u4eba\u58eb\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u4f46\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5f0f\u5355\u4e00\u3001\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u5c11\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7d27\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u4ee5\u60a3\u8005\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u56db\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u63a5\u53e3\uff08\u6447\u6746\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u624b\u52bf\u3001\u7535\u751f\u7406\uff08EOG\uff09\uff09\u7684\u7535\u52a8\u8f6e\u6905\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8fde\u7eed\u751f\u547d\u4f53\u5f81\uff08\u5fc3\u7387\u53d8\u5f02\u3001\u8840\u6c27\u3001\u76ae\u80a4\u6e29\u5ea6\uff09\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u70b9\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u7406\u4f20\u611f\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6307\u4ee4\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u8fc720\u540d\u7528\u6237\u3001500\u6b21\u6307\u4ee4\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5065\u5eb7\u6570\u636e\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e0a\u4f20\u4e91\u7aef\uff0c\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u901a\u8fc7APP\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a5\u6536\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "result": "\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u5c0f\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff08\u6447\u674699%\uff0c\u8bed\u97f397%\uff0c\u624b\u52bf95%\uff09\uff0c\u95ed\u73af\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea620\u6beb\u79d2\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b26\u5408\u56fd\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u62a4\u7406\u53cd\u9988\u53ca\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6d88\u8017\u5747\u6709\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7535\u52a8\u8f6e\u6905\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a9\u884c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season. Our framework successfully produces distinct forecasts for each of the four monsoon months (June-September) as well as the total seasonal average, demonstrating its utility for both intra-seasonal and seasonal outlooks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u5370\u5ea6\u590f\u5b63\u98ce\uff08ISM\uff09\u964d\u96e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u6548\u9884\u62a5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6c14\u5019\u9884\u62a5\u53ea\u7ed9\u51fa\u5355\u4e00\u3001\u533a\u57df\u5e73\u5747\u503c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5730\u533a\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5ea6\u3002\u5370\u5ea6\u590f\u5b63\u98ce\u5bf9\u5341\u51e0\u4ebf\u4eba\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u6c34\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5730\u533a\u964d\u96e8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u671f\u5927\u6c14\u4e0e\u6d77\u6d0b\u573a\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u4e3a\u591a\u901a\u9053\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u89c6\u9891\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e85\u5e74ERA5\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\u548cIMD\u964d\u96e8\u6570\u636e\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u4ece1-5\u6708\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u540e\u7eed\u5b63\u98ce\u56db\u4e2a\u6708\u964d\u96e8\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u683c\u70b9\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6708\u4ea7\u751f\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u603b\u5b63\u8282\u5e73\u5747\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b63\u8282\u5185\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u964d\u96e8\u9884\u62a5\u90fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5370\u5ea6\u590f\u5b63\u98ce\u964d\u96e8\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u652f\u6301\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u519c\u4e1a\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u548c\u6c34\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

Traditional frame-based cameras often fail in these scenarios for producing blurred images, particularly under low-light conditions. In contrast, event cameras capture changes in brightness asynchronously, offering low latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. These advantages make them suitable for robust perception during rapid motion and under challenging illumination. However, existing event camera datasets exhibit limitations in stereo configurations and multi-band sensing domains under various illumination conditions. To address this gap, we present M-SEVIQ, a multi-band stereo event visual and inertial quadruped dataset collected using a Unitree Go2 equipped with stereo event cameras, a frame-based camera, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and joint encoders. This dataset contains more than 30 real-world sequences captured across different velocity levels, illumination wavelengths, and lighting conditions. In addition, comprehensive calibration data, including intrinsic, extrinsic, and temporal alignments, are provided to facilitate accurate sensor fusion and benchmarking.

However, research on LLM-based approaches to document inconsistency detection is relatively limited. There are two key aspects of document inconsistency detection: (i) classification of whether there exists any inconsistency, and (ii) providing evidence of the inconsistent sentences. We focus on the latter, and introduce new comprehensive evidence-extraction metrics and a redact-and-retry framework with constrained filtering that substantially improves LLM-based document inconsistency detection over direct prompting.

Under review for a MELBA Special Issue. Minor revision resubmitted; decision pending", "summary": "Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c4\u89c6\u7f51\u819cOCT\u56fe\u50cf\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u8ddd\u5927\u3001\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8aOCT\u6210\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u5207\u7247\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u81f4\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6216\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u626b\u63cf\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cdINR\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7ed3\u5408en-face\u6a21\u6001\u8f85\u52a9\u5b9e\u73b0B-scan\u95f4\u7684\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u521b\u5efa\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u5747\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u53e3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347OCT\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u5927B-scan\u95f4\u9694\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u4f53\u79ef\u5206\u6790\u548c\u75c5\u53d8\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eINR\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u7684OCT\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u5f71\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u5efa\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u4e34\u5e8a\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u75c5\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot.

This study trained several commonly used encoder-based language models for automated scoring of long essays. The performance of these trained models was evaluated and compared with the ensemble models built upon the base language models with a token limit of 512?. The experimented models include BERT-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa), ensemble models integrating embeddings from multiple encoder models, and ensemble models of feature-based supervised machine learning models, including Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. We trained, validated, and tested each model on a dataset of 17,307 essays, with an 80%/10%/10% split, and evaluated model performance using Quadratic Weighted Kappa.

Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

We present a follow-the-leader endoscopic robot based on a flexible continuum structure designed to minimize contact between the endoscope body and intestinal walls, thereby reducing patient discomfort. To achieve this objective, we propose a vision-based deep reinforcement learning framework guided by monocular depth estimation. A realistic intestinal simulation environment was constructed in \\textit{NVIDIA Omniverse} to train and evaluate autonomous navigation strategies. Furthermore, thousands of synthetic intraluminal images were generated using NVIDIA Replicator to fine-tune the Depth Anything model, enabling dense three-dimensional perception of the intestinal environment with a single monocular camera. Subsequently, we introduce a geometry-aware reward and penalty mechanism to enable accurate lumen tracking.

We benchmark this behavior on two real-world settings: event-centric question answering over graph-structured knowledge (Event-QA) and persuasive response generation in Reddit ChangeMyView (CMV). Using LangChain and LangGraph, we compare a one-shot baseline against a plan--execute--replan agent equipped with task-specific tools (DBpedia SPARQL/lookup/schema exploration, Wikipedia-focused retrieval, and topical web search). We evaluate on 60 examples each from Event-QA and CMV (3 splits of 20), and report both mean end-to-end latency and per-example token cost estimates. We evaluate GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini under identical workflows and report accuracy and end-to-end latency. On Event-QA, the best tool-augmented configuration improves accuracy (e.g., 47.5\\% $\\rightarrow$ 67.5\\% for GPT-4o) while increasing latency by orders of magnitude ($\\sim$8s $\\rightarrow$ $\\sim$317s per example). On CMV, one-shot prompting is strongest (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves 75\\% at $\\sim$6s), and planning+search increases latency substantially without consistent gains. However, complex multi-tool orchestration exposes failure modes where the smaller model degrades.

This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e09\u7ef4CT\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e862D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e3D\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u51fa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u7136\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u548c3D\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u4f53\u79efCT\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9885\u5185\u51fa\u8840\uff08ICH\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5728YOLO Nano\u7cfb\u5217\u591a\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u9009\u62e9mAP@50\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u4f5c\u4e3a2D\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528ByteTrack\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728z\u8f74\u5f3a\u5316\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u75c5\u7076\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08Precision\uff09\u7531\u57fa\u7ebf2D\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u76840.703\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.779\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e863D\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u79fb\u52a8\u5352\u4e2d\u5355\u5143\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0bIoT\u8bca\u7597\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u75c5\u60a3\u4f18\u5148\u7b5b\u67e5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The material remains compliant during normal interaction but rapidly stiffens under impact, absorbing and dissipating fall-induced forces. Physics-based simulations guide protector placement and thickness and enable learning of active fall policies. Applied to a 42 kg life-size humanoid, the protector markedly reduces peak impact and allows repeated falls without hardware damage, including drops from 3 m and tumbles down long staircases.

This narrow focus prevents current benchmarks from revealing systematic reasoning failures, factual blind spots, and robustness limitations of modern LLMs. To bridge this gap, we present FactArena, a fully automated arena-style evaluation framework that conducts comprehensive, stage-wise benchmarking of LLMs across the complete fact-checking pipeline. FactArena integrates three key components: (i) an LLM-driven fact-checking process that standardizes claim decomposition, evidence retrieval via tool-augmented interactions, and justification-based verdict prediction; (ii) an arena-styled judgment mechanism guided by consolidated reference guidelines to ensure unbiased and consistent pairwise comparisons across heterogeneous judge agents; and (iii) an arena-driven claim-evolution module that adaptively generates more challenging and semantically controlled claims to probe LLMs' factual robustness beyond fixed seed data. Across 16 state-of-the-art LLMs spanning seven model families, FactArena produces stable and interpretable rankings. Our analyses further reveal significant discrepancies between static claim-verification accuracy and end-to-end fact-checking competence, highlighting the necessity of holistic evaluation.

Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary \"facts\" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6MovieRecapsQA\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5f71\u5267\u60c5\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u9891\u53ca\u5176\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u7ea68200\u7ec4\u95ee\u9898-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u7ec4\u7b54\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u5fc5\u8981\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u732e\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u5f88\u96be\u6709\u6548\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u4e0d\u662f\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u7531\u56de\u7b54\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e0c\u671b\u501f\u52a9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63a8\u52a8\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u95ee\u7b54\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6536\u96c6\u4e86YouTube\u7535\u5f71\u5267\u60c5\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u9891\u53ca\u5176\u5b57\u5e55\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u95ee\u9898-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u6807\u6ce8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u95ee\u9898\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u75287\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\uff1b2\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u504f\u597d\u6709\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b3\uff09\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7cbe\u51c6\u62bd\u53d6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u9650\uff1b4\uff09\u4e13\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u3002", "conclusion": "MovieRecapsQA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Conventional optimization-based controllers can enforce physical constraints, but they struggle to produce feasible solutions quickly when many obstacles are present. Diffusion models can generate diverse trajectories around obstacles, yet prior approaches lacked a general and efficient way to condition them on scene structure. In this paper, we show that combining diffusion-based warm-starting conditioned with a latent object-centric representation of the scene and with a collision-aware model predictive controller (MPC) yields reliable and efficient motion generation under strict time limits. Our approach conditions a diffusion transformer on the system state, task, and surroundings, using an object-centric slot attention mechanism to provide a compact obstacle representation suitable for control. The sampled trajectories are refined by an optimal control problem that enforces rigid-body dynamics and signed-distance collision constraints, producing feasible motions in real time. On benchmark tasks, this hybrid method achieved markedly higher success rates and lower latency than sampling-based planners or either component alone.

LATS reformulates jailbreaking as a breadth-first tree search over multi-turn dialogues, where each node incrementally injects missing content words from the attack goal into benign prompts. Evaluations on AdvBench and HarmBench demonstrate that LATS achieves 97-100% ASR on latest GPT, Claude, and Llama models with an average of only ~6.4 queries, compared to 20+ queries required by other methods. These results highlight conversational structure as a potent and under-protected attack surface, while demonstrating superior query efficiency in an era where high ASR is readily achievable.

Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as \"shallowfakes\") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques (\"deepfakes\"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. To further enhance this separation, we propose a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels.

Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings. We evaluate our method through qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted in a real 3D environment using a TIAGo robot. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOST-3DSG in dynamic object tracking.

While many believe that LLMs do not memorize much of their training data, recent work shows that substantial amounts of copyrighted text can be extracted from open-weight models. However, it remains an open question if similar extraction is feasible for production LLMs, given the safety measures these systems implement. We investigate this question using a two-phase procedure: (1) an initial probe to test for extraction feasibility, which sometimes uses a Best-of-N (BoN) jailbreak, followed by (2) iterative continuation prompts to attempt to extract the book. We evaluate our procedure on four production LLMs -- Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3 -- and we measure extraction success with a score computed from a block-based approximation of longest common substring (nv-recall). With different per-LLM experimental configurations, we were able to extract varying amounts of text. For the Phase 1 probe, it was unnecessary to jailbreak Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract text (e.g, nv-recall of 76.8% and 70.3%, respectively, for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone), while it was necessary for Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4.1. In some cases, jailbroken Claude 3.7 Sonnet outputs entire books near-verbatim (e.g., nv-recall=95.8%). GPT-4.1 requires significantly more BoN attempts (e.g., 20X), and eventually refuses to continue (e.g., nv-recall=4.0%).

Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing. To our knowledge, DreamLoop is the first method to enable cinemagraph generation for general scenes with flexible and intuitive controls.

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization.

This challenge becomes more pronounced in real-world settings, where viewpoint variability is unavoidable and can significantly disrupt policy performance. Existing methods typically learn invariance from multi-view observations at the scene level, but such approaches rely on visual appearance and fail to incorporate the physical dynamics essential for robust generalization. We propose View-Invariant Latent Action (VILA), which models a latent action capturing transition patterns across trajectories to learn view-invariant representations grounded in physical dynamics. VILA aligns these latent actions across viewpoints using an action-guided objective based on ground-truth action sequences. Experiments in both simulation and the real world show that VILA-based policies generalize effectively to unseen viewpoints and transfer well to new tasks, establishing VILA as a strong pretraining framework that improves robustness and downstream learning performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VILA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u89c9\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u975e\u5e38\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u89c6\u89d2\u591a\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6781\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4ece\u573a\u666f\u5c42\u9762\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "VILA\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6355\u6349\u8f68\u8ff9\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u501f\u52a9\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eVILA\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "VILA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We formalize this challenge as the \\textbf{Agent System Trilemma}: the inherent tension among achieving state-of-the-art performance, minimizing monetary cost, and ensuring rapid task completion. To dismantle this trilemma, we introduce EvoRoute, a self-evolving model routing paradigm that transcends static, pre-defined model assignments. Leveraging an ever-expanding knowledge base of prior experience, EvoRoute dynamically selects Pareto-optimal LLM backbones at each step, balancing accuracy, efficiency, and resource use, while continually refining its own selection policy through environment feedback. Experiments on challenging agentic benchmarks such as GAIA and BrowseComp+ demonstrate that EvoRoute, when integrated into off-the-shelf agentic systems, not only sustains or enhances system performance but also reduces execution cost by up to $80\\%$ and latency by over $70\\%$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u7531\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u534f\u540c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u590d\u6742AI\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e4b\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00'\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883'\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7cfb\u7edfEvoRoute\uff0c\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8d39\u7528\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8981\u517c\u987e\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6700\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6700\u5feb\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4e09\u8005\u5f88\u96be\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u8861\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u7684\u2018\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\u2019\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6EvoRoute\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u6309\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540cLLM\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728GAIA\u548cBrowseComp+\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0cEvoRoute\u96c6\u6210\u5165\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u540e\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u6210\u672c\u6700\u591a\u4e0b\u964d80%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c1170%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoRoute\u4e3aAI\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u80fd\u2014\u6210\u672c\u2014\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u81ea\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8def\u7531\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u671b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u3001\u591a\u8f6eAI\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

The core limitation lies in the prevalent ``track-then-descend'' paradigm, which treats the platform as a passive target and forces the quadcopter to perform complex, sequential maneuvers. This paper challenges that paradigm by introducing a bi-directional cooperative landing framework that redefines the roles of the vehicle and the platform. The essential innovation is transforming the problem from a single-agent tracking challenge into a coupled system optimization. Our key insight is that the mobile platform is not merely a target, but an active agent in the landing process. It proactively tilts its surface to create an optimal, stable terminal attitude for the approaching quadcopter. This active cooperation fundamentally breaks the sequential model by parallelizing the alignment and descent phases. Concurrently, the quadcopter's planning pipeline focuses on generating a time-optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory that minimizes energy consumption. This bi-directional coordination allows the system to execute the recovery in an agile manner, characterized by aggressive trajectory tracking and rapid state synchronization within transient windows. The framework's effectiveness, validated in dynamic scenarios, significantly improves the efficiency, precision, and robustness of autonomous quadrotor recovery in complex and time-constrained missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u5408\u4f5c\u7740\u9646\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba9\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u534f\u540c\u5b8c\u6210\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u4e3b\u7740\u9646\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u201c\u8ddf\u8e2a-\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\u201d\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7740\u9646\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u628a\u5e73\u53f0\u89c6\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u7740\u9646\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ba9\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3b\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u81ea\u8eab\u59ff\u6001\u534f\u52a9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7740\u9646\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5219\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u4e14\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u51c6\u548c\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u7740\u9646\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u9650\u5b9a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u81ea\u4e3b\u56de\u6536\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Both tasks play a critical role in online content moderation by enabling the detection and mitigation of harmful or offensive material, thereby contributing to safer digital environments. In this study, we examine the performance of three transformer-based models: BERT-base-multilingual-cased, RoBERTa-base, and XLM-RoBERTa-base with the first eight layers frozen, for multilingual sentiment analysis and hate speech detection. The evaluation is conducted across five languages: English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and French. The models are compared using standard performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To enhance model interpretability and provide deeper insight into prediction behavior, we integrate the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) framework, which highlights the contribution of individual words to the models decisions.

However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating \"topological short-circuits\" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u673a\u5236\u76843D\u7f51\u683c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u91c7\u96c6\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u7f51\u683c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7167\u642c2D\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e863D\u4e0e2D\u4e4b\u95f4\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u4e0d\u9c81\u68d2\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c40\u9650\u5f71\u54cd\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u9525\u91c7\u6837\uff08VCS\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5c04\u7ebf\u675f\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e2d\u592e\u51f9\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6d41\u5f62-\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7ea6\u675f\u6269\u6563\uff08HCD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6d41\u5f62\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u6b27\u6c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f51\u683c\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6291\u5236\u7eb9\u7406\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u504f\u7f6e\u3001\u907f\u514d\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d8a\u754c\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u62d3\u6251\u77ed\u8def\u3001\u6df7\u53e0\u73b0\u8c61\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u76843D\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u66f4\u597d\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u4eba\u4e0e3D\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u7f51\u683c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Through systematic evaluation of adversarial fine-tuning ratios, we identify 80% clean + 20% adversarial data as optimal. Data augmentation experiments reveal a capacity bottleneck in small models. Scaling from ELECTRA-small (14M parameters) to ELECTRA-base (110M parameters) eliminates the robustness-accuracy trade-off, achieving substantial improvements on both clean and adversarial data.

With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3001\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u7247\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u566a\u58f0\u8f83\u591a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u50f5\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u4e3b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5229\u7528Grounded SAM2\u8bc6\u522b\u524d\u666f\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u524d\u666f\u5360\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e00\u7c7b\u522b\u786e\u5b9a\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u9608\u503c\u3002\u6839\u636e\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u524d\u666f\u5360\u4f18\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u76f4\u63a5\u7f29\u653e\u5168\u56fe\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u5757\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u90a3\u4e00\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4e3b\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u56fe\u7247\u6784\u6210\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u6001\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u524d\u666f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u822a\u8ff9\u63a8\u7b97\uff08PiDR\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u5916\u90e8\u5bfc\u822a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982GNSS\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f9d\u7136\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5bfc\u822a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u672c\u8eab\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bfc\u822a\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u5e38\u89c4\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u5929\u7136\u662f\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u878d\u5165\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faPiDR\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u9879\uff0c\u5c06\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u201c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u201d\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u6c34\u4e0b\u65e0\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPiDR\u5bfc\u822a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc729%\u3002PiDR\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6761\u4ef6\u5747\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PiDR\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u4f4e\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bfc\u822a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002"}}

Based on this design, we develop an improved knowledge distillation chain-style model and leverage it to analyze and constrain the reasoning process of LLMs, thereby improving inference accuracy. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach using GPT-4 and LLaMA-3.3 on multiple public datasets.

However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods.

Existing post-training approaches for VLA models are typically offline, single-robot, or task-specific, limiting effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction. We introduce a Scalable Online Post-training (SOP) system that enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world. SOP tightly couples execution and learning through a closed-loop architecture in which a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, and asynchronously receives updated policies. This design supports prompt on-policy correction, scales experience collection through parallel deployment, and preserves generality during adaptation. SOP is agnostic to the choice of post-training algorithm; we instantiate it with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP). Across a range of real-world manipulation tasks including cloth folding, box assembly, and grocery restocking, we show that SOP substantially improves the performance of large pretrained VLA models while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours of real-world interaction, and performance scales near-linearly with the number of robots in the fleet. These results suggest that tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment is instrumental to enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08SOP\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u3001\u5355\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SOP\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u961f\u5217\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e0a\u4f20\u81f3\u4e91\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u540c\u6b65\u4e0b\u53d1\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u53ef\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\uff08\u5982HG-DAgger\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u548cRECAP\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6298\u53e0\u8863\u7269\u3001\u7bb1\u5b50\u7ec4\u88c5\u3001\u65e5\u7528\u54c1\u8865\u8d27\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cSOP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u5355\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u6709\u6548\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8054\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u7d27\u5bc6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Friederici"], "title": "Language Hierarchization Provides the Optimal Solution to Human Working Memory Limits", "comment": null, "summary": "Language is a uniquely human trait, conveying information efficiently by organizing word sequences in sentences into hierarchical structures. A central question persists: Why is human language hierarchical? In this study, we show that hierarchization optimally solves the challenge of our limited working memory capacity. We established a likelihood function that quantifies how well the average number of units according to the language processing mechanisms aligns with human working memory capacity (WMC) in a direct fashion. The maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of this function, tehta_MLE, turns out to be the mean of units. Through computational simulations of symbol sequences and validation analyses of natural language sentences, we uncover that compared to linear processing, hierarchical processing far surpasses it in constraining the tehta_MLE values under the human WMC limit, along with the increase of sequence/sentence length successfully. It also shows a converging pattern related to children's WMC development. These results suggest that constructing hierarchical structures optimizes the processing efficiency of sequential language input while staying within memory constraints, genuinely explaining the universal hierarchical nature of human language.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3a\u4f55\u4ee5\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff08hierarchical\uff09\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5176\u672c\u8d28\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d1\u73b0\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5951\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5206\u5c42\uff08hierarchical\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8bed\u8a00\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff1f\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u5bfb\u627e\u8fd9\u79cd\u666e\u904d\u73b0\u8c61\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8054\u7cfb\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5bb9\u91cf\uff08WMC\uff09\u7684\u5339\u914d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u7b26\u53f7\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u5904\u7406\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7ea6\u675f\u4e86\u7b26\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\uff08tehta_MLE\uff09\u4e0d\u8d85\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6781\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5e8f\u5217/\u53e5\u5b50\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u5206\u5c42\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6a21\u5f0f\u76f8\u5951\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u771f\u6b63\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u8a00\u666e\u904d\u5177\u6709\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

However, the nonlinear programs approximating the OCPs are inherently nonconvex due to the coupling between the dynamics and the event timing, and therefore, they are challenging to solve. Most approaches address this challenge by predefining waypoint times or just using nonconvex trajectory optimization, which simplifies the problem but often yields suboptimal solutions. To significantly improve the numerical properties, we propose a formulation with a time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme that partitions the prediction horizon into segments aligned with characteristic time constraints. Moreover, we develop a fast semidefinite-programming-based convex relaxation that exploits the sparsity pattern of the lifted formulation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the solution optimality and computational efficiency.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Synapse (Synergistic Associative Processing Semantic Encoding), a unified memory architecture that transcends static vector similarity. Drawing from cognitive science, Synapse models memory as a dynamic graph where relevance emerges from spreading activation rather than pre-computed links. By integrating lateral inhibition and temporal decay, the system dynamically highlights relevant sub-graphs while filtering interference.

Existing explainability approaches in robotics typically either focus on individual modules, which can be difficult to query from the perspective of high-level behaviour, or employ monolithic approaches, which do not exploit the modularity of robotic architectures. We present HEXAR (Hierarchical EXplainability Architecture for Robots), a novel framework that provides a plug-in, hierarchical approach to generate explanations about robotic systems. HEXAR consists of specialised component explainers using diverse explanation techniques (e.g., LLM-based reasoning, causal models, feature importance, etc) tailored to specific robot modules, orchestrated by an explainer selector that chooses the most appropriate one for a given query. We implement and evaluate HEXAR on a TIAGo robot performing assistive tasks in a home environment, comparing it against end-to-end and aggregated baseline approaches across 180 scenario-query variations. We observe that HEXAR significantly outperforms baselines in root cause identification, incorrect information exclusion, and runtime, offering a promising direction for transparent autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u67b6\u6784HEXAR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u6574\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5c42\u9762\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u6574\u4f53\u65b9\u6848\u4f46\u672a\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faHEXAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u5404\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6a21\u5757\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTIAGo\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9180\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u53d8\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c06HEXAR\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ca\u805a\u5408\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aHEXAR\u5728\u6839\u56e0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u6392\u9664\u53ca\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HEXAR\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

This arXiv version corresponds to the accepted paper and includes the full experimental results", "summary": "Most membership inference attacks (MIAs) against Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on global signals, like average loss, to identify training data. This approach, however, dilutes the subtle, localized signals of memorization, reducing attack effectiveness. We challenge this global-averaging paradigm, positing that membership signals are more pronounced within localized contexts. We introduce WBC (Window-Based Comparison), which exploits this insight through a sliding window approach with sign-based aggregation. Our method slides windows of varying sizes across text sequences, with each window casting a binary vote on membership based on loss comparisons between target and reference models. By ensembling votes across geometrically spaced window sizes, we capture memorization patterns from token-level artifacts to phrase-level structures. Extensive experiments across eleven datasets demonstrate that WBC substantially outperforms established baselines, achieving higher AUC scores and 2-3 times improvements in detection rates at low false positive thresholds.

Extended version of our ICCV 2025 highlight paper [arXiv:2503.07940]. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.07940", "summary": "Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. Results demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains.

The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion.\n  The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller.\n  Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations.

EComStage evaluates LLMs through seven separate representative tasks spanning diverse e-commerce scenarios, with all samples human-annotated and quality-checked. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus only on customer-oriented interactions, EComStage also evaluates merchant-oriented scenarios, including promotion management, content review, and operational support relevant to real-world applications. We evaluate a wide range of over 30 LLMs, spanning from 1B to over 200B parameters, including open-source models and closed-source APIs, revealing stage/orientation- specific strengths and weaknesses. Our results provide fine-grained, actionable insights for designing and optimizing LLM-based agents in real-world e-commerce settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EComStage\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5728\u7535\u5546\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u7b49\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u53ea\u91cd\u89c6\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6db5\u76d6\u4e03\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u7535\u5546\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u9762\u5411\u5ba2\u6237\u53ca\u5546\u5bb6\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf930\u591a\u79cdLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u53ca\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u77ed\u677f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7535\u5546\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5374\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u6781\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u6267\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\uff09\u3002\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7535\u5546\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86EComStage\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e03\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7535\u5546\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u56ca\u62ec\u5ba2\u6237\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u5546\u5bb6\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ec6\u5206\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6837\u672c\u5747\u7531\u4eba\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e0e\u8d28\u68c0\uff0c\u5bf930\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684LLM\uff08\u542b\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u95ed\u6e90\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u5404\u79cdLLM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5ba2\u6237/\u5546\u5bb6\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u5404\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u52a3\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "EComStage\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u7535\u5546\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy. This work highlights the importance of balancing model design and data quality for achieving efficient and generalizable zero-shot depth estimation. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/AnyDepth.

MiMo-V2-Flash adopts a hybrid attention architecture that interleaves Sliding Window Attention (SWA) with global attention, with a 128-token sliding window under a 5:1 hybrid ratio. The model is pre-trained on 27 trillion tokens with Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), employing a native 32k context length and subsequently extended to 256k. To efficiently scale post-training compute, MiMo-V2-Flash introduces a novel Multi-Teacher On-Policy Distillation (MOPD) paradigm. In this framework, domain-specialized teachers (e.g., trained via large-scale reinforcement learning) provide dense and token-level reward, enabling the student model to perfectly master teacher expertise.

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration.

Code:https://github.com/ChangPtR/AbdMLLM", "summary": "Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking.

To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance.

Existing memory frameworks provide limited support for temporally structured information across hierarchical levels, often leading to fragmented memories and unstable long-horizon personalization. We present TiMem, a temporal--hierarchical memory framework that organizes conversations through a Temporal Memory Tree (TMT), enabling systematic memory consolidation from raw conversational observations to progressively abstracted persona representations. TiMem is characterized by three core properties: (1) temporal--hierarchical organization through TMT; (2) semantic-guided consolidation that enables memory integration across hierarchical levels without fine-tuning; and (3) complexity-aware memory recall that balances precision and efficiency across queries of varying complexity. Under a consistent evaluation setup, TiMem achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on both benchmarks, reaching 75.30% on LoCoMo and 76.88% on LongMemEval-S. It outperforms all evaluated baselines while reducing the recalled memory length by 52.20% on LoCoMo. Manifold analysis indicates clear persona separation on LoCoMo and reduced dispersion on LongMemEval-S.

However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens.

While effective in assessing LLMs' cultural competency, SDP is prone to confounding factors such as prompt sensitivity, decoding parameters, and the inherent difficulty of generation over discrimination tasks due to larger output spaces. These factors complicate interpretation, making it difficult to determine if the poor performance is due to bias or the task design. To address this, we use inverse socio-demographic prompting (ISDP), where we prompt LLMs to discriminate and predict the demographic proxy from actual and simulated user behavior from different users. We use the Goodreads-CSI dataset (Saha et al., 2025), which captures difficulty in understanding English book reviews for users from India, Mexico, and the USA, and test four LLMs: Aya-23, Gemma-2, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3.1 with ISDP. Results show that models perform better with actual behaviors than simulated ones, contrary to what SDP suggests. However, performance with both behavior types diminishes and becomes nearly equal at the individual level, indicating limits to personalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9006\u5411\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\uff08ISDP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u5b9e\u9645\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u4f20\u7edfSDP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\uff08SDP\uff09\u5e38\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u6587\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5224\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u66f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5206\u8fa8\u662f\u504f\u89c1\u8fd8\u662f\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u9006\u5411\u793e\u4f1a\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u63d0\u793a\uff08ISDP\uff09\uff0c\u5373\u8ba9LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u5224\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u6d4b\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u56fd\u7c4d\uff09\u3002\u4ee5Goodreads-CSI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5370\u5ea6\u3001\u58a8\u897f\u54e5\u3001\u7f8e\u56fd\u7528\u6237\u9488\u5bf9\u82f1\u6587\u56fe\u4e66\u8bc4\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u96be\u5ea6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u56db\u6b3eLLMs\uff1aAya-23\u3001Gemma-2\u3001GPT-4o\u548cLLaMA-3.1\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5224\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfSDP\u7ed3\u8bba\u76f8\u53cd\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u4e14\u8d8b\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ISDP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u6587\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u66f4\u597d\u907f\u5f00SDP\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u6742\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u5373\u4fbf\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u3002"}}

Unlike existing siloed tools where pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but understands nothing about drape, and physics simulation predicts behaviour but cannot automatically fix patterns, Textile IR provides the semantic glue for integration through a seven-layer Verification Ladder -- from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). The architecture enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. We formalise fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and demonstrate how Textile IR's scene-graph representation enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs rather than pixel arrays. The framework addresses the compound uncertainty problem: when measurement errors in material testing, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine, sustainability claims become unreliable without explicit uncertainty tracking. We propose six research priorities and discuss deployment considerations for fashion SMEs where integrated workflows reduce specialised engineering requirements. Key contribution: a formal representation that makes engineering constraints perceptible, manipulable, and immediately consequential -- enabling designers to navigate sustainability, manufacturability, and aesthetic tradeoffs simultaneously rather than discovering conflicts after costly physical prototyping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Textile IR\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u65f6\u5c1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210CAD\u5236\u7248\u3001\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u8054\u901a\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u670d\u88c5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u5177\u5404\u81ea\u5b64\u7acb\uff1a\u5236\u7248\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6ce8\u91cd\u53ef\u7f1d\u5236\u6027\uff0c\u5374\u4e0d\u4e86\u89e3\u5e03\u6599\u60ac\u5782\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u6539\u826f\u7eb8\u6837\uff0c\u4e14\u5404\u73af\u8282\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u5bf9\u63a5\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5236\u9020\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6574\u5408\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u5b64\u5c9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51faTextile IR\u3002", "method": "Textile IR\u5efa\u7acb\u4e03\u5c42\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u68af\uff0c\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u8bed\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7269\u7406\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u73af\u8282\u8054\u901a\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u670d\u88c5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u53cd\u9988\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u53ef\u53cd\u9988\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u6750\u6599\u66ff\u6362\u4f1a\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u4f30\u7b97\u3002\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u5e76\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u4ee5\u4e09\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65f6\u5c1a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6750\u6599\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0eLCA\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7f3a\u9677\u9020\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u590d\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5c55\u793aAI\u5982\u4f55\u501f\u52a9Textile IR\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u63a7\u670d\u88c5\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u50cf\u7d20\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u5927\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9762\u5411\u4e2d\u5c0f\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u843d\u5730\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "Textile IR\u4e3a\u670d\u88c5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e26\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5236\u9020\u4e0e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u534f\u540c\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u5728\u6d41\u7a0b\u65e9\u671f\u5e73\u8861\u7f8e\u89c2\u3001\u5236\u9020\u4e0e\u73af\u4fdd\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd4\u5de5\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002"}}

Despite this non-uniqueness, language models are typically trained using a single canonical longest-prefix tokenization. We formalize homotokens-alternative valid subword segmentations of the same lexical item-as a strictly meaning-preserving form of data augmentation. We introduce a lightweight training architecture that conditions canonical next-token prediction on sampled homotoken variants via an auxiliary causal encoder and block-causal cross-attention, without modifying the training objective or token interface. In data-constrained pretraining, homotoken augmentation consistently delays overfitting under repeated data exposure and improves generalization across diverse evaluation datasets. In multilingual fine-tuning, we find that the effectiveness of homotokens depends on tokenizer quality: gains are strongest when canonical tokens are highly compressed and diminish when the tokenizer already over-fragments the input. Overall, homotokens provide a simple and modular mechanism for inducing tokenization invariance in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u540c\u4e49\u5b50\u8bcd\uff08homotokens\uff09\u201d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b50\u8bcd\u5207\u5206\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u800c\u975e\u552f\u4e00\u6807\u51c6\u5207\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5ef6\u7f13\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u6216token\u63a5\u53e3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53tokenizer\u672c\u8eab\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u538b\u7f29\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u5b50\u8bcd\u5207\u5206\u901a\u5e38\u9009\u62e9\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u5207\u5206\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u540c\u4e49\u5b50\u8bcd\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u552f\u4e00\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5207\u5206\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8bd5\u56fe\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u5207\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u540c\u4e49\u5b50\u8bcd\uff08homotokens\uff09\uff1a\u540c\u4e00\u8bcd\u9879\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u5b50\u8bcd\u5207\u5206\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8f85\u52a9\u56e0\u679c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0eblock-causal cross-attention\uff0c\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u540c\u4e49\u5b50\u8bcdtoken\u5e8f\u5217\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u6539\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548ctoken\u63a5\u53e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u4e49\u5b50\u8bcd\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u7f13\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5982\u679ctokenizer\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0chomotokens\u589e\u76ca\u6700\u5927\uff1b\u800c\u82e5tokenizer\u5207\u5206\u672c\u5c31\u5f88\u7ec6\u788e\uff0c\u5219\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u540c\u4e49\u5b50\u8bcd\u589e\u5f3a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u81ea\u7136\u5f15\u5165token\u5316\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u53ca\u5065\u58ee\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u6216tokenizer\u538b\u7f29\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We propose a novel approach that adapts any state-of-the-art image-based (depth) estimation model for video processing by integrating a new temporal module - trainable on a single GPU in a few days. Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods.

Current long-context benchmarks often trade off scalability and realism: synthetic tasks underrepresent real-world complexity, while fully manual annotation is costly to scale to extreme lengths and diverse scenarios. We present LongBench Pro, a more realistic and comprehensive bilingual benchmark of 1,500 naturally occurring long-context samples in English and Chinese spanning 11 primary tasks and 25 secondary tasks, with input lengths from 8k to 256k tokens. LongBench Pro supports fine-grained analysis with task-specific metrics and a multi-dimensional taxonomy of context requirement (full vs. partial dependency), length (six levels), and difficulty (four levels calibrated by model performance). To balance quality with scalability, we propose a Human-Model Collaborative Construction pipeline: frontier LLMs draft challenging questions and reference answers, along with design rationales and solution processes, to reduce the cost of expert verification. Experts then rigorously validate correctness and refine problematic cases. Evaluating 46 widely used long-context LLMs on LongBench Pro yields three findings: (1) long-context optimization contributes more to long-context comprehension than parameter scaling; (2) effective context length is typically shorter than the claimed context length, with pronounced cross-lingual misalignment; and (3) the \"thinking\" paradigm helps primarily models trained with native reasoning, while mixed-thinking designs offer a promising Pareto trade-off. In summary, LongBench Pro provides a robust testbed for advancing long-context understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LongBench Pro\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8986\u76d6\u4e2d\u82f1\u53cc\u8bed\u3001\u5305\u542b1500\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u6587\u672c\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e73\u8861\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5bf946\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7b80\u5355\u4e0d\u8d34\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5219\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u771f\u5b9e\u53c8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86LongBench Pro\uff1a\u6536\u96c6\u771f\u5b9e\u4e2d\u82f1\u957f\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d611\u5927\u7c7b\u300125\u7ec6\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\uff1a\u201c\u524d\u6cbf\u5927\u6a21\u578b+\u4e13\u5bb6\u201d\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u6821\u9a8c\u9898\u76ee\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5145\u4efb\u52a1\u5e93\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u5c42\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u7528\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u6d4b46\u79cd\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u9488\u5bf9\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6bd4\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u666e\u904d\u77ed\u4e8e\u6807\u79f0\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5185\u751f\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u201c\u7c7b\u601d\u8003\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u601d\u8003\u65b9\u5f0f\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u7684\u517c\u987e\u3002", "conclusion": "LongBench Pro\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8986\u76d6\u9762\u5e7f\u3001\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u660e\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u53cc\u8bed\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u6587\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u5e73\u53f0\u3002"}}

However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency.

In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SketchThinker-R1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u7684'\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f'\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700\u7b97\u529b\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u6d41\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u6162\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e38\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u805a\u7126\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u660e\u786e\u7684'\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f'\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8bd5\u56fe\u8ba9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u5177\u5907\u8fd9\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8349\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba9\u5176\u521d\u6b65\u5177\u5907\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3SketchJudge\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u5224\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u5426\u8349\u56fe\u5316\u5e76\u7ed9\u9ad8\u5206\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8ba9\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\u5728SketchJudge\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6cdb\u5316\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cSketchThinker-R1\u63a8\u7406\u6240\u9700token\u6570\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc764%\uff0c\u4f46\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6ca1\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u843d\u5730\u3002"}}

However, different regional varieties often employ different scripts to write the same language, rendering speech recognition output also subject to non-determinism in the output script. To mitigate this problem, we show that script is linearly encoded in the activation space of multilingual speech models, and that modifying activations at inference time enables direct control over output script. We find the addition of such script vectors to activations at test time can induce script change even in unconventional language-script pairings (e.g. Italian in Cyrillic and Japanese in Latin script). We apply this approach to inducing post-hoc control over the script of speech recognition output, where we observe competitive performance across all model sizes of Whisper.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982 Whisper\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5b57\u7b26\u811a\u672c\uff08script\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u8f6c\u6362\u5e38\u89c1\u8bed\u8a00-\u811a\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u811a\u672c\u8f6c\u5199\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u826f\u597d\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u666e\u904d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8e\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u533a\u57df\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u97f3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u53d8\u4f53\u5e38\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5b57\u7b26\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u811a\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5411\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5411\u91cf\u6dfb\u52a0\u7279\u5b9a\u201c\u811a\u672c\u5411\u91cf\u201d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u8bed\u8a00-\u811a\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Whisper\u7b49\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u811a\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c1\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u9002\u914d\u5982\u610f\u5927\u5229\u8bed-\u897f\u91cc\u5c14\u5b57\u6bcd\u3001\u65e5\u8bed-\u62c9\u4e01\u5b57\u6bcd\u7b49\u975e\u5e38\u89c4\u642d\u914d\uff0c\u5404\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u811a\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\u64cd\u7eb5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u540e\u5904\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u3001\u591a\u811a\u672c\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD.

To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability.

To address this theoretical fragmentation, this survey proposes a unified lifecycle-based taxonomy that organizes the research landscape into six distinct stages: Data Preparation, Model Preparation, Training, Alignment, Inference, and Evaluation. Within this framework, we provide a systematic review of the foundational theories and internal mechanisms driving LLM performance. Specifically, we analyze core theoretical issues such as the mathematical justification for data mixtures, the representational limits of various architectures, and the optimization dynamics of alignment algorithms. Moving beyond current best practices, we identify critical frontier challenges, including the theoretical limits of synthetic data self-improvement, the mathematical bounds of safety guarantees, and the mechanistic origins of emergent intelligence.

We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e38\u89c4\u63a9\u7801\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6574\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9879\u521b\u65b0\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5f53\u524d\u6027\u80fd\u7565\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u63a9\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a9\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7c7b\u522b\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u201c\u901a\u7528\u201d\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u5272\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5272\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u8272\u677f\uff082D\u683c\u96f7\u7801\u7f16\u6392\uff09\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff08tanh\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08sigmoid\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\uff09\u548cx\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e3b\u6d41\u63a9\u7801\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u7565\u900a\u4e8e\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u786e\u5b9e\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u72ec\u7279\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5982\u539f\u7406\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\uff0c\u8865\u9f50\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u914d\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite each modelled language learner starting from a blank slate, the presence of a bottleneck limiting the number of utterances to which the learner is exposed can lead to the emergence of language that lacks ambiguity, is governed by grammatical rules, and is consistent over successive generations, that is, one that is expressive, compositional and stable. The recent introduction of a more computationally tractable and ecologically valid semi supervised iterated learning model, combining supervised and unsupervised learning within an autoencoder architecture, has enabled exploration of language transmission dynamics for much larger meaning-signal spaces. Here, for the first time, the model has been successfully applied to a language learning task involving the communication of much more complex meanings: seven-segment display images. Agents in this model are able to learn and transmit a language that is expressive: distinct codes are employed for all 128 glyphs; compositional: signal components consistently map to meaning components, and stable: the language does not change from generation to generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u4e03\u6bb5\u6570\u7801\u663e\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\uff09\u4e2d\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4f20\u627f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u7740\u4ee3\u9645\u4f20\u9012\u9010\u6b65\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u6001\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5177\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u6b21\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u201c\u4e03\u6bb5\u663e\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u201d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u591a\u4ee3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u8bed\u8a00\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u9645\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5176\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u6240\u6709128\u79cd\u5b57\u5f62\u90fd\u5206\u914d\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fe1\u53f7\u7ec4\u6210\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f62\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8bed\u8a00\u968f\u7740\u4ee3\u9645\u4f20\u9012\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4e0d\u53d1\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u8a00\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e5f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ee3\u9645\u4f20\u9012\u673a\u5236\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u81ea\u53d1\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8d77\u6e90\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data. However, existing VideoLLMs remain challenging in identifying precise event boundaries in untrimmed videos, causing the generated captions to be not properly grounded. In this paper, we propose TA-Prompting, which enhances VideoLLMs via Temporal Anchors that learn to precisely localize events and prompt the VideoLLMs to perform temporal-aware video event understanding. During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video.

To further mitigate judgment hallucination, we propose a query-adaptive latent ensemble strategy that explicitly models heterogeneous model competence and interdependencies among LLMs, deriving a calibrated consensus decision.

Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization.

We propose a controlled Knowledge Graph-based synthetic framework that generates text from symmetric/inverse triples, train GPT-style autoregressive models from scratch, and evaluate memorization, logical inference, and in-context generalization to unseen entities to address these questions. We find a sharp phase transition in which relational semantics emerge with sufficient logic-bearing supervision, even in shallow (2-3 layer) models, and that successful generalization aligns with stable intermediate-layer signals. Finally, order-matched forward/reverse tests and a diffusion baseline indicate that reversal failures are primarily driven by autoregressive order bias rather than deficient inversion semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u9006\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u65f6\uff0c\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u53ca\u53cd\u8f6c\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5982\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4e0e\u9006\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5173\u7cfb\u53cd\u8f6c\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u6b20\u7f3a\u8fd8\u662f\u56e0\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5177\u5907\u5bf9\u79f0/\u9006\u5411\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u7684\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u7684GPT\u98ce\u683c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u5907\u8db3\u591f\u903b\u8f91\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6d45\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff082-3\u5c42\uff09\u4e5f\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5173\u7cfb\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u660e\u663e\u201c\u76f8\u53d8\u201d\uff0c\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7a33\u5b9a\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u5339\u914d\u6b63/\u53cd\u5411\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53cd\u8f6c\u5931\u8d25\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u81ea\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9006\u5411\u903b\u8f91\u8bed\u4e49\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u76d1\u7763\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53cd\u8f6c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5173\u7cfb\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal ReID benchmarks (WMVeID863, MSVR310, RGBNT100) validate the effectiveness of our method.

Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PrismVAU\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u65e0\u987b\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684VAU\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "PrismVAU\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f97\u5230\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\uff1b\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf/\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ec6\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u6240\u6709\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u5747\u901a\u8fc7\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08APE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPrismVAU\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u9700\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5e27\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u5bc6\u96c6\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PrismVAU\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u7b97\u529b\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

While prior studies attribute this advantage to the superior English-centric capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we find that such measurements are significantly distorted by structural priors inherent in evaluation benchmarks. Specifically, we identify exposure bias and a gold availability prior-both driven by the disproportionate concentration of resources in English-as well as cultural priors rooted in topic locality, as factors that hinder accurate assessment of genuine language preference. To address these biases, we propose DeLP (Debiased Language Preference), a calibrated metric designed to explicitly factor out these structural confounds. Our analysis using DeLP reveals that the previously reported English preference is largely a byproduct of evidence distribution rather than an inherent model bias. Instead, we find that retrievers fundamentally favor monolingual alignment between the query and the document language. Building on this insight, we introduce DELTA (DEbiased Language preference-guided Text Augmentation), a lightweight and efficient mRAG framework that strategically leverages monolingual alignment to optimize cross-lingual retrieval and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DELTA consistently outperforms English pivoting and mRAG baselines across diverse languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u76ee\u524d\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08mRAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6240\u8c13\u7684\u201c\u504f\u597d\u82f1\u8bed\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u5176\u5b9e\u662f\u7531\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u9020\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807DeLP\u548c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5DELTA\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u504f\u89c1\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u8bed\u79cdRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u8fd9\u88ab\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u82f1\u8bed\u66f4\u64c5\u957f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u53d7\u5230\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6587\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u53bb\u504f\u6307\u6807DeLP\uff0c\u5254\u9664\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u597d\u30022\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eDeLP\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u7d22\u90e8\u5206\u5b9e\u9645\u504f\u597d\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6587\u6863\u8bed\u8a00\u4e00\u81f4\u30023\uff09\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faDELTA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5355\u8bed\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u8bed\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDELTA\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u8f6c\u548c\u4e3b\u6d41mRAG\u57fa\u7ebf\u90fd\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u53bb\u9664\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5355\u8bed\u4e00\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "mRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u88ab\u8bef\u8ba4\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u5b9e\u5219\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u89c1\u9020\u6210\u3002\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u540e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u8bed\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6bd4\u82f1\u8bed\u4e2d\u8f6c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation.

Two critical limitations in the field are addressed. First, individual detection methods exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses depending on data characteristics, making method selection non-trivial and prone to suboptimal results. Second, automated, contextual explanations for detected changes are largely absent. The proposed ensemble method aggregates results from ten distinct changepoint detection algorithms, achieving superior performance and robustness compared to individual methods. Additionally, an LLM-powered explanation pipeline automatically generates contextual narratives, linking detected changepoints to potential real-world historical events. For private or domain-specific data, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution enables explanations grounded in user-provided documents.

To this end, we construct VTONQA, the first multi-dimensional quality assessment dataset specifically designed for VTON, which contains 8,132 images generated by 11 representative VTON models, along with 24,396 mean opinion scores (MOSs) across three evaluation dimensions (i.e., clothing fit, body compatibility, and overall quality). Based on VTONQA, we benchmark both VTON models and a diverse set of image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, revealing the limitations of existing methods and highlighting the value of the proposed dataset.

This study addresses the critical need for accurate digitization of Bahnar language documents through optical character recognition (OCR) technology. Digitizing scanned paper documents poses significant challenges, as degraded image quality from broken or blurred areas introduces considerable OCR errors that compromise information retrieval systems. We propose a comprehensive approach combining advanced table and non-table detection techniques with probability-based post-processing heuristics to enhance recognition accuracy. Our method first applies detection algorithms to improve input data quality, then employs probabilistic error correction on OCR output. Experimental results indicate a substantial improvement, with recognition accuracy increasing from 72.86% to 79.26%.

To address these, we propose LAMS-Edit, leveraging intermediate states from the inversion process--an essential step in real-image editing--during edited image generation. Specifically, latent representations and attention maps from both processes are combined at each step using weighted interpolation, controlled by a scheduler. This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA.

Adaptive self-consistency methods mitigate this issue by adjusting the sampling budget; however, they rely on count-based stopping rules that treat all responses equally, often leading to unnecessary sampling. We propose Reliability-Aware Adaptive Self-Consistency (ReASC), which addresses this limitation by reframing adaptive sampling from response counting to evidence sufficiency, leveraging response-level confidence for principled information aggregation. ReASC operates in two stages: a single-sample decision stage that resolves instances confidently answerable from a single response, and a reliability-aware accumulation stage that aggregates responses by jointly leveraging their frequency and confidence. Across five models and four datasets, ReASC consistently achieves the best accuracy-cost trade-off compared to existing baselines, yielding improved inference efficiency across model scales from 3B to 27B parameters. As a concrete example, ReASC reduces inference cost by up to 70\\% relative to self-consistency while preserving accuracy on GSM8K using Gemma-3-4B-it.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReASC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u6027\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u591a\u91c7\u6837\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u6d3d\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff08Self-Consistency\uff09\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u81ea\u6d3d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e38\u5e38\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f9d\u7136\u4e0d\u9ad8\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aReASC\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u4ece\u8ba1\u6570\u673a\u5236\u8f6c\u4e3a\u8bc1\u636e\u5145\u5206\u6027\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9636\u6bb5\u4e00\u5bf9\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e00\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u76f4\u63a5\u7ed9\u51fa\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u9636\u6bb5\u4e8c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7b54\u6848\u9891\u6b21\u4e0e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7406\u6027\u7d2f\u79ef\u591a\u4e2a\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u805a\u5408\u51fa\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cReASC\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6298\u4e2d\u3002\u4e3e\u4f8b\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728Gemma-3-4B-it\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884cGSM8K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u6d3d\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6700\u9ad870%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "ReASC\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, CoT often becomes unnecessarily long, increasing computation cost without actual accuracy gains or sometimes even degrading performance, a phenomenon known as ``overthinking''. We propose a multi-stage efficient reasoning method that combines supervised fine-tuning -- via rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting -- with reinforcement learning using an adaptive length penalty. We introduce a lightweight reward function that penalizes tokens generated after the first correct answer but encouraging self-verification only when beneficial. We conduct a holistic evaluation across seven diverse reasoning tasks, analyzing the accuracy--response length trade-off. Our approach reduces response length by an average of 28\\% for 8B models and 40\\% for 32B models, while incurring only minor performance drops of 1.6 and 2.5 points, respectively. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it achieves a superior trade-off compared to more complex state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods, scoring 76.6, in terms of the area under the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy curve ($\\text{AUC}_{\\text{OAA}}$) -- 5 points above the base model and 2.5 points above the second-best approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4(CoT)\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u751a\u81f3\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5373\u201c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u601d\u8003\u201d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u95f4\u7684\u66f4\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1.\u5229\u7528\u62d2\u7edd\u91c7\u6837\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9\u91cd\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c2.\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4ea7\u751f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u540e\u60e9\u7f5a\u989d\u5916token\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u76ca\u65f6\u7ed9\u4e88\u6fc0\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c8B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c1128%\uff0c32B\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c1140%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1.6\u548c2.5\u5206\u3002\u6548\u80fd-\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6743\u8861\u6307\u6807\uff08OAA\u66f2\u7ebfAUC\uff09\u8fbe\u523076.6\uff0c\u9886\u5148\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b5\u5206\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b21\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd52.5\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5355\u5374\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u7f29\u77ed\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation.

In this paper, we propose a Sparse Autoencoder-based framework for retrieving and steering semantically interpretable internal features associated with high-level linguistic behaviors. Our method employs a contrastive feature retrieval pipeline based on controlled semantic oppositions, combing statistical activation analysis and generation-based validation to distill monosemantic functional features from sparse activation spaces. Using the Big Five personality traits as a case study, we demonstrate that our method enables precise, bidirectional steering of model behavior while maintaining superior stability and performance compared to existing activation steering methods like Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA). We further identify an empirical effect, which we term Functional Faithfulness, whereby intervening on a specific internal feature induces coherent and predictable shifts across multiple linguistic dimensions aligned with the target semantic attribute.

While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser.

We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints.

This issue arises from architectural limits of transformers, where counting is performed across layers, leading to degraded precision for larger counting problems due to depth constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a simple test-time strategy inspired by System-2 cognitive processes that decomposes large counting tasks into smaller, independent sub-problems that the model can reliably solve. We evaluate this approach using observational and causal mediation analyses to understand the underlying mechanism of this System-2-like strategy. Our mechanistic analysis identifies key components: latent counts are computed and stored in the final item representations of each part, transferred to intermediate steps via dedicated attention heads, and aggregated in the final stage to produce the total count. Experimental results demonstrate that this strategy enables LLMs to surpass architectural limitations and achieve high accuracy on large-scale counting tasks. This work provides mechanistic insight into System-2 counting in LLMs and presents a generalizable approach for improving and understanding their reasoning behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3cSystem-2\u8ba4\u77e5\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898\u62c6\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5c0f\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u503c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u5176\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u662ftransformer\u7ed3\u6784\u5728\u5c42\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u53d7\u9650\u65f6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u51c6\u8ba1\u6570\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7System-2\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u5c0f\u800c\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5b50\u8ba1\u6570\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u9010\u6b65\u5408\u5e76\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u4e2d\u4ecb\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u5176\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u5c40\u90e8\u8ba1\u6570\u88ab\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u5b50\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6c47\u603b\u751f\u6210\u6574\u4f53\u8ba1\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8ba1\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u539f\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u6570\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684LLM\u8ba1\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6d1e\u89c1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u63a8\u5e7f\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning.

We empirically show that under Top-5 retrieval with the gold document included, LLM answers vary substantially across permutations of the retrieved set, even when the gold document is fixed in the first position. This reveals a previously underexplored sensitivity to retrieval permutations. Although robust RAG methods primarily focus on enhancing LLM robustness to low-quality retrieval and mitigating positional bias to distribute attention fairly over long contexts, neither approach directly addresses permutation sensitivity. In this paper, we propose Stable-RAG, which exploits permutation sensitivity estimation to mitigate permutation-induced hallucinations. Stable-RAG runs the generator under multiple retrieval orders, clusters hidden states, and decodes from a cluster-center representation that captures the dominant reasoning pattern. It then uses these reasoning results to align hallucinated outputs toward the correct answer, encouraging the model to produce consistent and accurate predictions across document permutations. Experiments on three QA datasets show that Stable-RAG significantly improves answer accuracy, reasoning consistency and robust generalization across datasets, retrievers, and input lengths compared with baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0RAG\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Stable-RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347LLM\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u5c11\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStable-RAG\uff0c\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u987a\u5e8f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u83b7\u5f97\u4e3b\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u7531\u68c0\u7d22\u987a\u5e8f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "Stable-RAG\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u5747\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RAG\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0cStable-RAG\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff1aFlow Matching PointNet\u548cDiffusion PointNet\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u7684\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u538b\u529b\u573a\u548c\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u3001\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u89c4\u5219\u683c\u70b9\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u4f2a\u5f71\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u9891\u566a\u58f0\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06PointNet\u5206\u522b\u5d4c\u5165\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u6d41\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5411\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u6807\u51c6\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u91cd\u6784\u51fa\u7269\u7406\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u8f93\u5165\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u8ba1\u7b97\u57df\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u50cf\u7d20\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e0e\u4ee5\u5f80\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4e2d\u95f4\u7f51\u7edc\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u7684GNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56PointNet\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4e3a\u7b80\u6d01\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u622a\u9762\u548c\u671d\u5411\u7684\u5706\u67f1\u5916\u6d41\u7a33\u6001\u4e0d\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6d41\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u538b\u529b\u573a\u53ca\u5347/\u963b\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u666e\u901aPointNet\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Flow Matching PointNet\u4e0eDiffusion PointNet\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u4f53\u6d41\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, recent work shows that LRMs often arrive at the correct answer before completing these textual reasoning steps, indicating the presence of latent reasoning -- internal, non-verbal computation encoded in hidden states. While this phenomenon has been explored in English, its multilingual behavior remains largely unknown. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of multilingual latent reasoning in LRMs across 11 languages. Using a truncation-based strategy, we examine how the correct answer emerges as the model is given only partial reasoning traces, allowing us to measure stepwise latent prediction formation. Our results reveal clear evidence of multilingual latent reasoning, though unevenly: strong in resource-rich languages, weaker in low-resource ones, and broadly less observable on harder benchmarks. To understand whether these differences reflect distinct internal mechanisms, we further perform representational analyses. Despite surface-level disparities, we find that the internal evolution of predictions is highly consistent across languages and broadly aligns with English -- a pattern suggesting an English-centered latent reasoning pathway.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eLRMs\u5728\u82f1\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u524d\u5c31\u5f97\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u975e\u8bed\u8a00\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793aLRMs\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u5176\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9488\u5bf911\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5373\u9010\u6b65\u622a\u65ad\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\u4f55\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b64\u65b9\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u9884\u6d4b\u6f14\u5316\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u532e\u4e4f\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53ca\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5f31\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8868\u5c42\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u591a\u4e0e\u82f1\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LRMs\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u8bed\u8a00\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u8868\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u4ee5\u82f1\u6587\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u4e0e\u504f\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur.

To address these challenges, we propose SentGraph, a sentence-level graph-based RAG framework that explicitly models fine-grained logical relationships between sentences for multi-hop question answering. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical sentence graph offline by first adapting Rhetorical Structure Theory to distinguish nucleus and satellite sentences, and then organizing them into topic-level subgraphs with cross-document entity bridges.

We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\\mathsf{TC^0} \\subsetneq \\mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures.

To address this, we propose MMFormalizer, which extends autoformalization beyond text by integrating adaptive grounding with entities from real-world mathematical and physical domains. MMFormalizer recursively constructs formal propositions from perceptually grounded primitives through recursive grounding and axiom composition, with adaptive recursive termination ensuring that every abstraction is supported by visual evidence and anchored in dimensional or axiomatic grounding. We evaluate MMFormalizer on a new benchmark, PhyX-AF, comprising 115 curated samples from MathVerse, PhyX, Synthetic Geometry, and Analytic Geometry, covering diverse multimodal autoformalization tasks. Results show that frontier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro achieve the highest compile and semantic accuracy, with GPT-5 excelling in physical reasoning, while geometry remains the most challenging domain. Overall, MMFormalizer provides a scalable framework for unified multimodal autoformalization, bridging perception and formal reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multimodal autoformalization method capable of handling classical mechanics (derived from the Hamiltonian), as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.

Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods.

Standard supervised training lacks explicit annotations for symptom evolution, while direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) is hindered by sparse binary rewards. To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets.

Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components.

However, existing benchmarks and evaluation frameworks for assessing the information-gathering and diagnostic reasoning abilities of medical large language models (LLMs) have not been rigorously evaluated. To address these gaps, we present MedDialogRubrics, a novel benchmark comprising 5,200 synthetically constructed patient cases and over 60,000 fine-grained evaluation rubrics generated by LLMs and subsequently refined by clinical experts, specifically designed to assess the multi-turn diagnostic capabilities of LLM. Our framework employs a multi-agent system to synthesize realistic patient records and chief complaints from underlying disease knowledge without accessing real-world electronic health records, thereby mitigating privacy and data-governance concerns. We design a robust Patient Agent that is limited to a set of atomic medical facts and augmented with a dynamic guidance mechanism that continuously detects and corrects hallucinations throughout the dialogue, ensuring internal coherence and clinical plausibility of the simulated cases. Furthermore, we propose a structured LLM-based and expert-annotated rubric-generation pipeline that retrieves Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) guidelines and utilizes the reject sampling to derive a prioritized set of rubric items (\"must-ask\" items) for each case. We perform a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models and demonstrate that, across multiple assessment dimensions, current models face substantial challenges.

Targetting AACL 2026", "summary": "Long-context question answering (QA) over literary texts poses significant challenges for modern large language models, particularly in low-resource languages. We address the scarcity of long-context QA resources for Indic languages by introducing LittiChoQA, the largest literary QA dataset to date covering many languages spoken in the Gangetic plains of India. The dataset comprises over 270K automatically generated question-answer pairs with a balanced distribution of factoid and non-factoid questions, generated from naturally authored literary texts collected from the open web. We evaluate multiple multilingual LLMs on non-factoid, abstractive QA, under both full-context and context-shortened settings. Results demonstrate a clear trade-off between performance and efficiency: full-context fine-tuning yields the highest token-level and semantic-level scores, while context shortening substantially improves throughput.

We introduce F-DPO (Factuality-aware Direct Preference Optimization), a simple extension of DPO that uses only binary factuality labels. F-DPO (i) applies a label-flipping transformation that corrects misordered preference pairs so the chosen response is never less factual than the rejected one, and (ii) adds a factuality-aware margin that emphasizes pairs with clear correctness differences, while reducing to standard DPO when both responses share the same factuality. We construct factuality-aware preference data by augmenting DPO pairs with binary factuality indicators and synthetic hallucinated variants. Across seven open-weight LLMs (1B-14B), F-DPO consistently improves factuality and reduces hallucination rates relative to both base models and standard DPO. On Qwen3-8B, F-DPO reduces hallucination rates by five times (from 0.424 to 0.084) while improving factuality scores by 50 percent (from 5.26 to 7.90). F-DPO also generalizes to out-of-distribution benchmarks: on TruthfulQA, Qwen2.5-14B achieves plus 17 percent MC1 accuracy (0.500 to 0.585) and plus 49 percent MC2 accuracy (0.357 to 0.531).

MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise \"experts\" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench. These results suggest that query-conditioned, hierarchy-aware fusion is an effective way to strengthen visual grounding and reduce hallucination in modern MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TGIF\uff08Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f9d\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u5185\u5bb9\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4ee5\u5f80\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u6587\u672c\u4fa7\uff0c\u672a\u89e6\u8fbe\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757TGIF\uff1a\u89c6\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u4e3a\u201c\u4e13\u5bb6\u201d\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6587\u672c\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5404\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u5916\u90e8\u878d\u5408\u201d\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u65b0\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u4f4e\u3002\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLaVA-1.5-7B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "TGIF\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001OCR\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u539f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ScienceQA\u3001GQA\u548cMMBench\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u666e\u904d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5c42\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\uff08TGIF\uff09\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u662f\u52a0\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In contrast, we observe that their corresponding base LLMs often remain well-calibrated. This naturally motivates us to calibrate PoLLM confidence using the base LLM as a reference. This work proposes two ways to achieve this. A straightforward solution, BaseCal-ReEval, evaluates PoLLM's responses by feeding them into the base LLM to get average probabilities as confidence. While effective, this approach introduces additional inference overhead. To address this, we propose BaseCal-Proj, which trains a lightweight projection to map the final-layer hidden states of PoLLMs back to those of their base LLMs. These projected states are then processed by the base LLM's output layer to derive base-calibrated confidence for PoLLM's responses. Notably, BaseCal is an unsupervised, plug-and-play solution that operates without human labels or LLM modifications. Experiments across five datasets and three LLM families demonstrate the effectiveness of BaseCal, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by an average of 42.90\\% compared to the best unsupervised baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08PoLLMs\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08base LLMs\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5BaseCal\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLMs\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7ecf\u5e38\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f30\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u901a\u5e38\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6539\u5584\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBaseCal\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09BaseCal-ReEval\uff1a\u5c06PoLLM\u8f93\u51fa\u9001\u56de\u57fa\u7840LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u8f83\u9ad8\uff1b2\uff09BaseCal-Proj\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6295\u5f71\u5934\uff0c\u5c06PoLLM\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u57fa\u7840LLM\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840LLM\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u83b7\u5f97\u6821\u51c6\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cBaseCal\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584PoLLM\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5c06Expected Calibration Error (ECE) \u964d\u4f4e\u4e8642.90%\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "BaseCal\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e14\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u969c\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Unified Thinker\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982Nano Banana\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u63a8\u7406-\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u67b6\u6784Unified Thinker\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\uff08Thinker\uff09\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08Generator\uff09\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u6d41\u7a0b\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u5176\u6839\u636e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u53cd\u9988\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7531\u63a8\u7406\u76f4\u89c2\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUnified Thinker\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff0cUnified Thinker\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u6f14\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u54c1\u8d28\u3002"}}

Prior work typically decomposes inference into prefill and decode stages, with the decode stage dominating total latency. To reduce time and memory complexity in the decode stage, a line of work introduces sparse-attention algorithms. In this paper, we show, both empirically and theoretically, that sparse attention can paradoxically increase end-to-end complexity: information loss often induces significantly longer sequences, a phenomenon we term ``Less is Less'' (Lil). To mitigate the Lil problem, we propose an early-stopping algorithm that detects the threshold where information loss exceeds information gain during sparse decoding.

Existing approaches rely on patch-based processing and costly post-processing for instance separation, sacrificing context and efficiency. We introduce LSP-DETR (Local Star Polygon DEtection TRansformer), a fully end-to-end framework that uses a lightweight transformer with linear complexity to process substantially larger images without additional computational cost. Nuclei are represented as star-convex polygons, and a novel radial distance loss function allows the segmentation of overlapping nuclei to emerge naturally, without requiring explicit overlap annotations or handcrafted post-processing. Evaluations on PanNuke and MoNuSeg show strong generalization across tissues and state-of-the-art efficiency, with LSP-DETR being over five times faster than the next-fastest leading method.

By representing the entire conversation as a temporal graph, we present a novel graph-based method for detecting dialogue-level hallucinations. Our framework models each dialogue as a node, encoding it using a sentence transformer. We explore two different ways of connectivity: i) shared-entity edges, which connect turns that refer to the same entities; ii) temporal edges, which connect contiguous turns in the conversation. Message-passing is used to update the node embeddings, allowing flow of information between related nodes. The context-aware node embeddings are then combined using attention pooling into a single vector, which is then passed on to a classifier to determine the presence and type of hallucinations. We demonstrate that our method offers slightly improved performance over existing methods. Further, we show the attention mechanism can be used to justify the decision making process.

First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements.

It can effectively reduce factuality hallucinations, but faithfulness hallucinations still exist. Previous methods for detecting faithfulness hallucinations either neglect to capture the models' internal reasoning processes or handle those features coarsely, making it difficult for discriminators to learn. This paper proposes a semantic-level internal reasoning graph-based method for detecting faithfulness hallucination. Specifically, we first extend the layer-wise relevance propagation algorithm from the token level to the semantic level, constructing an internal reasoning graph based on attribution vectors. This provides a more faithful semantic-level representation of dependency. Furthermore, we design a general framework based on a small pre-trained language model to utilize the dependencies in LLM's reasoning for training and hallucination detection, which can dynamically adjust the pass rate of correct samples through a threshold.

To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation.

Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

Prior work on compact reasoning shortens such chains through probabilistic sampling, heuristics, or supervision from frontier models, but offers limited insight into whether models internally encode token-level functional importance for answer generation. We address this gap diagnostically and propose greedy pruning, a likelihood-preserving deletion procedure that iteratively removes reasoning tokens whose removal minimally degrades model likelihood under a specified objective, yielding length-controlled reasoning chains. We evaluate pruned reasoning in a distillation framework and show that students trained on pruned chains outperform a frontier-model-supervised compression baseline at matched reasoning lengths.

We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG.

Although many approaches seek to align large language models (LLMs) with human moral values, how to enable them morally sensitive has been extremely challenging.

Specifically, we propose two pragmatic inference methods that faciliate LLMs to diagnose morally benign and hazardous input and correct moral errors, whereby enhancing LLMs' moral sensitivity. A central strength of our pragmatic inference methods is their unified perspective: instead of modeling moral discourses across semantically diverse and complex surface forms, they offer a principled perspective for designing pragmatic inference procedures grounded in their inferential loads.

LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements.

Input attribution methods aim to highlight each input token's contributions to the model's output, but existing approaches are typically model-agnostic, and do not focus on transformer-specific architectures, leading to limited faithfulness. To address this, we propose Grad-ELLM, a gradient-based attribution method for decoder-only transformer-based LLMs. By aggregating channel importance from gradients of the output logit with respect to attention layers and spatial importance from attention maps, Grad-ELLM generates heatmaps at each generation step without requiring architectural modifications.

However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08MultiMedia-Agent\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u51fa\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AIGC\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u4e9f\u9700\u80fd\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiMedia-Agent\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u3002\u878d\u5165\u6280\u80fd\u4e60\u5f97\u7406\u8bba\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u53ca\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMultiMedia-Agent\u5728\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b0\u5174\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "MultiMedia-Agent\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5730\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u8d28\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u5f53\u524dAIGC\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

We elicit preference judgments from LLMs by prompting them to select the funnier response and found that user clusters exhibit distinct preference patterns and that the LLM results can resemble those of particular clusters.

Such representations restrict their scalability to arbitrary output resolutions and hinder the geometric detail recovery. This paper introduces InfiniDepth, which represents depth as neural implicit fields. Through a simple yet effective local implicit decoder, we can query depth at continuous 2D coordinates, enabling arbitrary-resolution and fine-grained depth estimation. To better assess our method's capabilities, we curate a high-quality 4K synthetic benchmark from five different games, spanning diverse scenes with rich geometric and appearance details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InfiniDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks across relative and metric depth estimation tasks, particularly excelling in fine-detail regions. It also benefits the task of novel view synthesis under large viewpoint shifts, producing high-quality results with fewer holes and artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aInfiniDepth\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u573a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53ca\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86InfiniDepth\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u573a\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u9690\u5f0f\u573a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u4e8c\u7ef4\u5750\u6807\u4e0a\u67e5\u8be2\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u81ea\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf4K\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cInfiniDepth\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ec6\u8282\u533a\u57df\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u5c11\u7a7a\u6d1e\u4e0e\u4f2a\u5f71\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "InfiniDepth\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We present the first neuron-level interpretability study of emotion-sensitive neurons (ESNs) in LALMs and provide causal evidence that such units exist in Qwen2.5-Omni, Kimi-Audio, and Audio Flamingo 3. Across these three widely used open-source models, we compare frequency-, entropy-, magnitude-, and contrast-based neuron selectors on multiple emotion recognition benchmarks. Using inference-time interventions, we reveal a consistent emotion-specific signature: ablating neurons selected for a given emotion disproportionately degrades recognition of that emotion while largely preserving other classes, whereas gain-based amplification steers predictions toward the target emotion. These effects arise with modest identification data and scale systematically with intervention strength. We further observe that ESNs exhibit non-uniform layer-wise clustering with partial cross-dataset transfer. Taken together, our results offer a causal, neuron-level account of emotion decisions in LALMs and highlight targeted neuron interventions as an actionable handle for controllable affective behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u654f\u611f\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff08ESNs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u60c5\u611f\u662f\u53e3\u5934\u4ea4\u6d41\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5c1a\u672a\u6e05\u695a\u5927\u578b\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LALMs\uff09\u5185\u90e8\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u60c5\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8be5\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u611f\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5728Qwen2.5-Omni\u3001Kimi-Audio\u548cAudio Flamingo 3\u7b49\u4e3b\u6d41\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u3001\u71b5\u3001\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\uff09\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u611f\u65f6\u76f8\u5173\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86ESNs\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u6b21\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u611f\u9009\u51fa\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u8fdb\u884c\u6291\u5236\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u5bf9\u8be5\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5219\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u60c5\u611f\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\u968f\u5e72\u9884\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cESNs\u5728\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u5448\u73b0\u975e\u5747\u5300\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u90e8\u5206\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ee5\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u7ea7\u522b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86LALMs\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u76ee\u6807\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u60c5\u611f\u76f8\u5173AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape.

We propose ToxiGAN, a class-aware text augmentation framework that combines adversarial generation with semantic guidance from large language models (LLMs). To address common issues in GAN-based augmentation such as mode collapse and semantic drift, ToxiGAN introduces a two-step directional training strategy and leverages LLM-generated neutral texts as semantic ballast. Unlike prior work that treats LLMs as static generators, our approach dynamically selects neutral exemplars to provide balanced guidance.

The Japanese bar examination is a particularly demanding benchmark, requiring not only advanced legal reasoning but also strict adherence to complex answer formats that involve joint evaluation of multiple propositions. While recent studies have reported improvements by decomposing such questions into simpler true--false judgments, these approaches have not been systematically evaluated under the original exam format and scoring scheme, leaving open the question of whether they truly capture exam-level competence. In this paper, we present a self-verification model trained on a newly constructed dataset that faithfully replicates the authentic format and evaluation scale of the exam. Our model is able to exceed the official passing score when evaluated on the actual exam scale, marking the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of an LLM passing the Japanese bar examination without altering its original question structure or scoring rules.

We observe a distinct \"decoupled mechanism\": while CoT improves distributional alignment, final accuracy is dictated by CoT content (99% variance contribution), whereas distributional ranking is governed by model priors (over 80%). Step-wise analysis further shows that while CoT's influence on accuracy grows monotonically during the reasoning process, distributional structure is largely determined by LLM's intrinsic priors.

However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch. Across models from 3B to 30B, Anchor-GRPO outperforms baseline GRPO and First-step GRPO, improving task success and tool efficiency. Notably, WebAnchor-30B achieves 46.0% pass@1 on BrowseComp and 76.4% on GAIA. Anchor-GRPO also demonstrates strong scalability, getting higher accuracy as model size and context length increase.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAnchor-GRPO\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9996\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u6574\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eWeb\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u641c\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9996\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u5f71\u54cd\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u88ab\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAnchor-GRPO\uff0c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u9996\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u535a\u5f08\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5224\u6807\u51c6\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u8ba1\u5212\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728BrowseComp\u3001BrowseComp-Zh\u3001GAIA\u548cXBench-DeepSearch\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAnchor-GRPO\u5728\u5404\u7c7b\uff083B\u81f330B\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GRPO\u53caFirst-step GRPO\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u6548\u7387\u300230B\u6a21\u578b\u5728BrowseComp\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523046.0% pass@1\uff0c\u5728GAIA\u4e0a\u4e3a76.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "Anchor-GRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u89c6\u9996\u6b65\u89c4\u5212\u5e76\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8fWeb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5927\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u957f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

A Systematic Study on African Languages", "comment": "13 pages, 1 figure, 19 tables", "summary": "Cross-lingual transfer is essential for building NLP systems for low-resource African languages, but practitioners lack reliable methods for selecting source languages. We systematically evaluate five embedding similarity metrics across 816 transfer experiments spanning three NLP tasks, three African-centric multilingual models, and 12 languages from four language families. We find that cosine gap and retrieval-based metrics (P@1, CSLS) reliably predict transfer success ($\u03c1= 0.4-0.6$), while CKA shows negligible predictive power ($\u03c1\\approx 0.1$).

However, existing approaches typically treat all tokens in a response indiscriminately and enforce uncertainty over the entire vocabulary. This global treatment results in unnecessary utility degradation and extends optimization to content-agnostic regions. To address these limitations, we propose PALU (Prefix-Aware Localized Unlearning), a framework driven by a local entropy maximization objective across both temporal and vocabulary dimensions. PALU reveals that (i) suppressing the sensitive prefix alone is sufficient to sever the causal generation link, and (ii) flattening only the top-$k$ logits is adequate to maximize uncertainty in the critical subspace. These findings allow PALU to avoid redundant optimization across the full vocabulary and parameter space while minimizing collateral damage to general model performance.

While Large Language Models possess strong reasoning capabilities, they struggle to emulate this self-evolution: fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while existing memory-based methods rely on passive semantic matching that often retrieves noise. To address these challenges, we propose MemRL, a framework that enables agents to self-evolve via non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory. MemRL explicitly separates the stable reasoning of a frozen LLM from the plastic, evolving memory. Unlike traditional methods, MemRL employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism that filters candidates by semantic relevance and then selects them based on learned Q-values (utility). These utilities are continuously refined via environmental feedback in an trial-and-error manner, allowing the agent to distinguish high-value strategies from similar noise. Extensive experiments on HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench demonstrate that MemRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis experiments confirm that MemRL effectively reconciles the stability-plasticity dilemma, enabling continuous runtime improvement without weight updates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6MemRL\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6765\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u822c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5229\u7528\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u5f80\u7ecf\u9a8c\u81ea\u6211\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u5bb9\u6613\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u566a\u97f3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faMemRL\u6846\u67b6\uff1aLLM\u672c\u8eab\u53c2\u6570\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u62d3\u5c55\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5148\u6839\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7b5b\u9009\u5019\u9009\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60Q\u503c\uff08\u6548\u7528\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\uff0cQ\u503c\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u65ad\u66f4\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728HLE\u3001BigCodeBench\u3001ALFWorld\u3001Lifelong Agent Bench\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMemRL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aMemRL\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "conclusion": "MemRL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u8ba9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u6b65\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

We propose a novel explainability-guided training framework, X-MuTeST (eXplainable Multilingual haTe Speech deTection), for hate speech detection that combines high-level semantic reasoning from large language models (LLMs) with traditional attention-enhancing techniques. We extend this research to Hindi and Telugu alongside English by providing benchmark human-annotated rationales for each word to justify the assigned class label. The X-MuTeST explainability method computes the difference between the prediction probabilities of the original text and those of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. Final explanations are computed as the union between LLM explanations and X-MuTeST explanations. We show that leveraging human rationales during training enhances both classification performance and explainability. Moreover, combining human rationales with our explainability method to refine the model attention yields further improvements. We evaluate explainability using Plausibility metrics such as Token-F1 and IOU-F1 and Faithfulness metrics such as Comprehensiveness and Sufficiency.

Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has succeeded in specific domains , the field lacks large-scale, high-quality, and difficulty-calibrated data for general reasoning. To address this, we propose UltraLogic, a framework that decouples the logical core of a problem from its natural language expression through a Code-based Solving methodology to automate high-quality data production. The framework comprises hundreds of unique task types and an automated calibration pipeline across ten difficulty levels. Furthermore, to mitigate binary reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap, we introduce the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism, utilizing graded penalties to effectively distinguish perfect responses from those with logical flaws. Our experiments demonstrate that task diversity is the primary driver for reasoning enhancement , and that BFR, combined with a difficulty matching strategy, significantly improves training efficiency, guiding models toward global logical optima.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faUltraLogic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u9a71\u52a8\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u7ea7\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165BFR\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u8f85\u52a9\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u77ed\u7f3a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u901a\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u532e\u4e4f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUltraLogic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u7801\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5206\u5341\u7ea7\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u8ba1BFR\uff08Bipolar Float Reward\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5316\u60e9\u7f5a\u66f4\u597d\u533a\u5206\u56de\u7b54\u4f18\u52a3\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0cBFR\u52a0\u4e0a\u96be\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u903b\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UltraLogic\u6846\u67b6\u548cBFR\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u532e\u4e4f\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u7a00\u758f\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We introduce MalruleLib, a learning-science-grounded framework that translates documented misconceptions into executable procedures, drawing on 67 learning-science and mathematics education sources, and generates step-by-step traces of malrule-consistent student work. We formalize a core student-modeling problem as Malrule Reasoning Accuracy (MRA): infer a misconception from one worked mistake and predict the student's next answer under cross-template rephrasing. Across nine language models (4B-120B), accuracy drops from 66% on direct problem solving to 40% on cross-template misconception prediction. MalruleLib encodes 101 malrules over 498 parameterized problem templates and produces paired dual-path traces for both correct reasoning and malrule-consistent student reasoning. Because malrules are executable and templates are parameterizable, MalruleLib can generate over one million instances, enabling scalable supervision and controlled evaluation. Using MalruleLib, we observe cross-template degradations of 10-21%, while providing student step traces improves prediction by 3-15%.

Purpose: To create RXL-RADSet, a radiologist-verified synthetic multi-RADS benchmark, and compare validity and accuracy of open-weight small language models (SLMs) with a proprietary model for RADS assignment. Materials and Methods: RXL-RADSet contains 1,600 synthetic radiology reports across 10 RADS (BI-RADS, CAD-RADS, GB-RADS, LI-RADS, Lung-RADS, NI-RADS, O-RADS, PI-RADS, TI-RADS, VI-RADS) and multiple modalities. Reports were generated by LLMs using scenario plans and simulated radiologist styles and underwent two-stage radiologist verification. We evaluated 41 quantized SLMs (12 families, 0.135-32B parameters) and GPT-5.2 under a fixed guided prompt. Primary endpoints were validity and accuracy; a secondary analysis compared guided versus zero-shot prompting. Results: Under guided prompting GPT-5.2 achieved 99.8% validity and 81.1% accuracy (1,600 predictions). Pooled SLMs (65,600 predictions) achieved 96.8% validity and 61.1% accuracy; top SLMs in the 20-32B range reached ~99% validity and mid-to-high 70% accuracy. Performance scaled with model size (inflection between <1B and >=10B) and declined with RADS complexity primarily due to classification difficulty rather than invalid outputs. Guided prompting improved validity (99.2% vs 96.7%) and accuracy (78.5% vs 69.6%) compared with zero-shot. Conclusion: RXL-RADSet provides a radiologist-verified multi-RADS benchmark; large SLMs (20-32B) can approach proprietary-model performance under guided prompting, but gaps remain for higher-complexity schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86RXL-RADSet\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u914d\u591a\u79cdRADS\u5206\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1RADS\u4f53\u7cfb\u5e2e\u52a9\u89c4\u8303\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5206\u7ea7\u6307\u5357\u590d\u6742\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u7ea7\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8RADS\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e10\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540cRADS\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08\u5982BI-RADS\u3001LI-RADS\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u7ecf\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u4e24\u8f6e\u6838\u9a8c\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e861600\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5408\u6210\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08RXL-RADSet\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u5bf941\u6b3e\u91cf\u5316SLM\uff08\u6db5\u76d612\u4e2a\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u8303\u56f40.135-32B\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u6709GPT-5.2\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u7ea7\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u5206\u7ea7\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0bGPT-5.2\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8fbe99.8%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e3a81.1%\u3002SLM\u6574\u4f53\u6709\u6548\u602796.8%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u738761.1%\uff1b20-32B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53ef\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea699%\u548c\u4e2d\u9ad870%\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u91cf\u8d8a\u5927\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u8d8a\u597d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u4e8e10B\u53c2\u6570\u540e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u66f4\u590d\u6742RADS\u4f53\u7cfb\u4e0b\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u5206\u7c7b\u96be\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "RXL-RADSet\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u6838\u5b9e\u7684\u591aRADS\u901a\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5927\u578bSLM\uff0820-32B\uff09\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u5df2\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u5411\u590d\u6742\u5206\u7ea7\u4f53\u7cfb\u4ecd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}}

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6ST-Bench\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684STReasoner\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u7a7a\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u901a\u3001\u7535\u7f51\u3001\u75be\u75c5\u4f20\u64ad\uff09\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u6ce8\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u63d0\u51faST-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u75c5\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9884\u6d4b\u56db\u5927\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u968f\u673a\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08SDE\uff09\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u30022\uff09\u63d0\u51faSTReasoner\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u30023\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1S-GRPO\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "STReasoner\u5728\u56db\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534717%-135%\uff0c\u4ec5\u97000.004\u500d\u4e8e\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, few studies have focused on the interpretability of emergent languages. The research exposed in this paper proposes an Automated Semantic Rules Detection (ASRD) algorithm, which extracts relevant patterns in messages exchanged by agents trained with two different datasets on the Lewis Game, which is often studied in the context of emergent communication. ASRD helps at the interpretation of the emergent communication by relating the extracted patterns to specific attributes of the input data, thereby considerably simplifying subsequent analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08ASRD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u6790\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u81ea\u53d1\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u901a\u4fe1\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u53d1\u901a\u4fe1\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5e0c\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u53d1\u8bed\u8a00\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86ASRD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5728Lewis Game\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u5efa\u7acb\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "ASRD\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u6316\u6398\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5bf9\u81ea\u53d1\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ASRD\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u53d1\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}
