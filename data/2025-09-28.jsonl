In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly\nmethod for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over\nsignals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs).

Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered\nstaircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot\nthat pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable\nstance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,\nsuch as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be\ndifficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that\naddresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal\nrobot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during\nmanipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled\nperception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason\nabout feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core\ncontribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses\nproprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an\nobject's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the\nperception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,\nclosing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even\nafter partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from\nphysical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to\nit being too heavy.

Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent\nediting in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent\nActivation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies\nwithout modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two\nstages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect\nstates associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing\nmodule that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy\ntowards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in\nmulti-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal\nperception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through\na latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision\nactivations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.\nExtensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE\nachieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer\ncumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially\nincreases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task\ncompletion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,\nfeasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of\nlearned robot policies."}

This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it\nlimits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it\nmakes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both\nchallenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating\ncomplex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to\ngrasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies\nthe sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning.

Advanced\ndriving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling\nlimits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle\navoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety\nbenefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective\nevaluations.

Prior research on long-term\nskill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or\nemploys other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this\ngap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic\nshared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers\nacquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an\nautonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a\nhighly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism\nalong with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from\nautonomy based on the human driver's performance during training.

First, a multitask training scheme\nintroduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and\npitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic\nannotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one\nover phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To\ncombine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state\ntransducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning\nand fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show\nthat this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual\nrecognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also\ncompared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates\nfrom 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets."}

We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box\npoisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID\ncompromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a\nclosed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal\nperturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction\nset constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow\nVideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini.

To\naddress this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves\ntext-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation\non a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model\nto fill the intermediate frames.

Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects\nframework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence\nlength, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the\nMemory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the\ncontributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during\nprocessing.

Previous work addressing output\nhomogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.\nWe address this gap in the literature directly by making the following\ncontributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task\ncategories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.\n(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output\nhomogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that\nincreases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is\nundesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We\nchallenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by\nincreasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we\ndemonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of\noutput homogenization."}

Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the\ndecision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches\nor misclassification of targets.

However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,\nparticularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI\nclassification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing\nrealistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.\nnon-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)\ntechnique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring\nnaturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of\nadversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification\nmodels.

This process is computationally intensive and\nincreases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly\nmethod for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over\nsignals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a\ndirect quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high\nuncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.\nTo test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements\nderived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and\nuse it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that\nNTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and\nsimple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.\nFurthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding\nonly the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection\nperformance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs\ninto the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or\nNTPs alone.

In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,\nLearning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by\ndemonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form\ntext labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the\nCrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples\ninto the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM\nthen iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the\ndesired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a\ncoherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By\nincorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing\nmodel, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond\nthe environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then\nintroduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages\nCrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained\ntasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and\nreal hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and\nproviding a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via\nreinforcement learning."}

Wang", "Haozhe Chen", "Henry Che", "Albert J. Zhai", "Shenlong Wang"], "title": "Human-like Navigation in a World Built for Humans", "comment": "CoRL 2025. Project website: https://reasonnav.github.io/", "summary": "When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like\nan office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking\nothers for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations\nefficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot\nnavigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus\nhighly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present\nReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like\nnavigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language\nmodel (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on\nnavigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and\nreasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and\nshow that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate\nefficiently in large, complex buildings."}
