These challenges become particularly prominent when generating captions for motion-centric videos, where precise depiction of intricate movements and limb dynamics is crucial yet often neglected. To alleviate this gap, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline that integrates kinematic-based motion computation with linguistic parsing, enabling detailed decomposition and description of complex human motions. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the Kinematic Parsing Motion Benchmark (KPM-Bench), a novel open-source dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained motion understanding. KPM-Bench consists of (i) fine-grained video-caption pairs that comprehensively illustrate limb-level dynamics in complex actions, (ii) diverse and challenging question-answer pairs focusing specifically on motion understanding, and (iii) a meticulously curated evaluation set specifically designed to assess hallucination phenomena associated with motion descriptions. Furthermore, to address hallucination issues systematically, we propose the linguistically grounded Motion Parsing and Extraction (MoPE) algorithm, capable of accurately extracting motion-specific attributes directly from textual captions. Leveraging MoPE, we introduce a precise hallucination evaluation metric that functions independently of large-scale vision-language or language-only models. By integrating MoPE into the GRPO post-training framework, we effectively mitigate hallucination problems, significantly improving the reliability of motion-centric video captioning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6KPM-Bench\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5MoPE\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u590d\u6742\u7ec6\u8282\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u907f\u514d\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5173\u6ce8\u4eba\u4f53\u7ec6\u81f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec6\u8282\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u5b57\u5e55\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u7ec6\u81f4\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86KPM-Bench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891-\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\u3001\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7406\u89e3\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faMoPE\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ece\u5b57\u5e55\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u52a8\u4f5c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u6765\u72ec\u7acb\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6700\u540e\u5c06MoPE\u878d\u5165GRPO\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "KPM-Bench\u4e3a\u7ec6\u81f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8d44\u6e90\u3002MoPE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b57\u5e55\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd0\u52a8\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u52a8\u4f5c\u63cf\u8ff0\u53ca\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Existing methods that tackle text-to-hand-motion generation or hand animation captioning rely on studio-captured datasets with limited actions and contexts, making them costly to scale to \"in-the-wild\" settings. Further, contemporary models and their training schemes struggle to capture animation fidelity with text-motion alignment. To address this, we (1) introduce '3D Hands in the Wild' (3D-HIW), a dataset of 32K 3D hand-motion sequences and aligned text, and (2) propose CLUTCH, an LLM-based hand animation system with two critical innovations: (a) SHIFT, a novel VQ-VAE architecture to tokenize hand motion, and (b) a geometric refinement stage to finetune the LLM. To build 3D-HIW, we propose a data annotation pipeline that combines vision-language models (VLMs) and state-of-the-art 3D hand trackers, and apply it to a large corpus of egocentric action videos covering a wide range of scenarios. To fully capture motion in-the-wild, CLUTCH employs SHIFT, a part-modality decomposed VQ-VAE, which improves generalization and reconstruction fidelity. Finally, to improve animation quality, we introduce a geometric refinement stage, where CLUTCH is co-supervised with a reconstruction loss applied directly to decoded hand motion parameters. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion and motion-to-text tasks, establishing the first benchmark for scalable in-the-wild hand motion modelling.

However, this task remains challenging due to the presence of texture-less surfaces, complex illumination patterns, deformation, and a lack of in-vivo datasets with reliable ground truth. In this paper, we propose **PRISM** (Pose-Refinement with Intrinsic Shading and edge Maps), a self-supervised learning framework that leverages anatomical and illumination priors to guide geometric learning. Our approach uniquely incorporates edge detection and luminance decoupling for structural guidance. Specifically, edge maps are derived using a learning-based edge detector (e.g., DexiNed or HED) trained to capture thin and high-frequency boundaries, while luminance decoupling is obtained through an intrinsic decomposition module that separates shading and reflectance, enabling the model to exploit shading cues for depth estimation.

However, the standard multi-step Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining is resource-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming, which is also often unavailable in many areas. Consequently, predicting HER2 levels directly from H&E slides has emerged as a potential alternative solution. It has been shown to be effective to use virtual IHC images from H&E images for automatic HER2 scoring. However, the pixel-level virtual staining methods are computationally expensive and prone to reconstruction artifacts that can propagate diagnostic errors. To address these limitations, we propose the Latent-Guided Dual-Stream Network (LGD-Net), a novel framework that employes cross-modal feature hallucination instead of explicit pixel-level image generation. LGD-Net learns to map morphological H&E features directly to the molecular latent space, guided by a teacher IHC encoder during training. To ensure the hallucinated features capture clinically relevant phenotypes, we explicitly regularize the model training with task-specific domain knowledge, specifically nuclei distribution and membrane staining intensity, via lightweight auxiliary regularization tasks.

Existing approaches aim to improve diversity in training partners to approximate human behavior, but these partners are static and fail to capture adaptive behavior of humans. Exposing robots to adaptive behaviors is critical, yet when both agents learn simultaneously in a multi-agent setting, they often converge to opaque implicit coordination strategies that only work with the agents they were co-trained with. Such agents fail to generalize when paired with new partners. In order to capture the adaptive behavior of humans, we model the human-robot teaming scenario as an Interactive Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (I-POMDP), explicitly modeling human adaptation as part of the state. We propose a nested training regime to approximately learn the solution to a finite-level I-POMDP. In this framework, agents at each level are trained against adaptive agents from the level below. This ensures that the ego agent is exposed to adaptive behavior during training while avoiding the emergence of implicit coordination strategies, since the training partners are not themselves learning. We train our method in a multi-episode, required cooperation setup in the Overcooked domain, comparing it against several baseline agents designed for human-robot teaming. We evaluate the performance of our agent when paired with adaptive partners that were not seen during training. Our results demonstrate that our agent not only achieves higher task performance with these adaptive partners but also exhibits significantly greater adaptability during team interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42I-POMDP\u548c\u5d4c\u5957\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4eba\u7c7b\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eAI\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u76f8\u4e92\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ec5\u7528\u9759\u6001\u4f19\u4f34\u4ee3\u7406\u4eba\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7684\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f19\u4f34\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a5\u89e6\u66f4\u591a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4eba\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eI-POMDP\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u9012\u8fdb\u5d4c\u5957\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u90fd\u9762\u5bf9\u66f4\u4f4e\u5c42\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f46\u9759\u6b62\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u66b4\u9732\uff0c\u53c8\u4e0d\u4ea7\u751f\u4ec5\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f19\u4f34\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Overcooked\u6e38\u620f\u591a\u56de\u5408\u5fc5\u9700\u5408\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u5df2\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u505a\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f19\u4f34\u914d\u5bf9\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u65b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f19\u4f34\u914d\u5408\u65f6\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u56e2\u961f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5d4c\u5957\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u4eba\u2014\u673a\u56e2\u961f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u3001\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u8005\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u56e2\u961f\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Lederer", "Yi Yao"], "title": "QueryPlot: Generating Geological Evidence Layers using Natural Language Queries for Mineral Exploration", "comment": null, "summary": "Mineral prospectivity mapping requires synthesizing heterogeneous geological knowledge, including textual deposit models and geospatial datasets, to identify regions likely to host specific mineral deposit types. This process is traditionally manual and knowledge-intensive. We present QueryPlot, a semantic retrieval and mapping framework that integrates large-scale geological text corpora with geologic map data using modern Natural Language Processing techniques. We curate descriptive deposit models for over 120 deposit types and transform the State Geologic Map Compilation (SGMC) polygons into structured textual representations. Given a user-defined natural language query, the system encodes both queries and region descriptions using a pretrained embedding model and computes semantic similarity scores to rank and spatially visualize regions as continuous evidence layers. QueryPlot supports compositional querying over deposit characteristics, enabling aggregation of multiple similarity-derived layers for multi-criteria prospectivity analysis. In a case study on tungsten skarn deposits, we demonstrate that embedding-based retrieval achieves high recall of known occurrences and produces prospective regions that closely align with expert-defined permissive tracts. Furthermore, similarity scores can be incorporated as additional features in supervised learning pipelines, yielding measurable improvements in classification performance. QueryPlot is implemented as a web-based system supporting interactive querying, visualization, and export of GIS-compatible prospectivity layers.To support future research, we have made the source code and datasets used in this study publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86QueryPlot\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5730\u8d28\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0e\u5730\u8d28\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6620\u5c04\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7NLP\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f85\u52a9\u77ff\u4ea7\u8fdc\u666f\u533a\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u77ff\u4ea7\u8fdc\u666f\u533a\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u5730\u8d28\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u6587\u5b57\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\uff09\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u7a0b\u4eba\u5de5\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u6574\u7406120\u591a\u79cd\u77ff\u5e8a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u30022. \u5c06\u5730\u8d28\u56fe\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u30023. \u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u533a\u57df\u63cf\u8ff0\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff0c\u6392\u5e8f\u5e76\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u30024. \u652f\u6301\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u53ca\u591a\u51c6\u5219\u7684\u8fdc\u666f\u5206\u6790\u30025. \u5728\u94a8\u77fd\u5361\u5ca9\u77ff\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u30026. \u5c06\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u30027. \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3a\u7f51\u7aef\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u53ef\u4e0b\u8f7dGIS\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "1. \u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u56de\u53ec\u5df2\u77e5\u77ff\u5e8a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u30022. \u9884\u6d4b\u51fa\u7684\u8fdc\u666f\u533a\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u7b26\u30023. \u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u30024. \u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u4e92\u52a8\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u51fa\u30025. \u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "QueryPlot\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5316\u5730\u8f85\u52a9\u77ff\u4ea7\u8fdc\u666f\u533a\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches still rely on additional trainable components, limiting their generalisation and practical applicability. In this work, we investigate to what extent text-based remote sensing segmentation can be achieved without additional training, by relying solely on existing foundation models. We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates contrastive and generative VLMs with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), enabling a fully training-free or lightweight LoRA-tuned pipeline. Our contrastive approach employs CLIP as mask selector for SAM's grid-based proposals, achieving state-of-the-art open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) in a completely zero-shot setting. In parallel, our generative approach enables reasoning and referring segmentation by generating click prompts for SAM using GPT-5 in a zero-shot setting and a LoRA-tuned Qwen-VL model, with the latter yielding the best results. Extensive experiments across 19 remote sensing benchmarks, including open-vocabulary, referring, and reasoning-based tasks, demonstrate the strong capabilities of our approach.

Reducing the physical demands of this task through intelligent and personalized assistance has significant implications, particularly in industries involving repetitive low-level assembly activities. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a neural network controller for a modular Hip-Knee exoskeleton designed to assist squatting tasks. The neural network controller was trained via reinforcement learning (RL) in a physics-based, human-exoskeleton interaction simulation environment. The controller generated real-time hip and knee assistance torques based on recent joint-angle and velocity histories. Five healthy adults performed three-minute metronome-guided squats under three conditions: (1) no exoskeleton (No-Exo), (2) exoskeleton with Zero-Torque, and (3) exoskeleton with active assistance (Assistance). Physiological effort was assessed using indirect calorimetry and heart rate monitoring, alongside concurrent kinematic data collection. Results show that the RL-based controller adapts to individuals by producing torque profiles tailored to each subject's kinematics and timing. Compared with the Zero-Torque and No-Exo condition, active assistance reduced the net metabolic rate by approximately 10%, with minor reductions observed in heart rate. However, assisted trials also exhibited reduced squat depth, reflected by smaller hip and knee flexion. These preliminary findings suggest that the proposed controller can effectively lower physiological effort during repetitive squatting, motivating further improvements in both hardware design and control strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9acb\u819d\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\u8e72\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u751f\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0b\u8e72\u662f\u5bf9\u4e0b\u80a2\u8981\u6c42\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u590d\u4e0b\u8e72\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u5408\u5c24\u4e3a\u6d88\u8017\u4f53\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u667a\u80fd\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e0b\u8e72\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u4f53\u529b\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u75b2\u52b3\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u9acb-\u819d\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5176\u6839\u636e\u5386\u53f2\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u9acb\u819d\u52a9\u529b\u626d\u77e9\u3002\u4e94\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u6210\u5e74\u5fd7\u613f\u8005\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b8c\u6210\u8282\u594f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e09\u5206\u949f\u4e0b\u8e72\uff1a\u65e0\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\uff08No-Exo\uff09\u3001\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u96f6\u626d\u77e9\uff08Zero-Torque\uff09\u3001\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u4e3b\u52a8\u52a9\u529b\uff08Assistance\uff09\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u95f4\u63a5\u91cf\u70ed\u6cd5\u548c\u5fc3\u7387\u76d1\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u96c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u4e2a\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u751f\u6210\u52a9\u529b\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u52a9\u529b\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u65e0\u52a9\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u51c0\u4ee3\u8c22\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea610%\uff0c\u5fc3\u7387\u4e5f\u7565\u6709\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4f46\u8f85\u52a9\u65f6\u4e0b\u8e72\u6df1\u5ea6\u6709\u51cf\u5c0f\uff0c\u9acb\u819d\u5c48\u66f2\u89d2\u5ea6\u53d8\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u53cd\u590d\u4e0b\u8e72\u7684\u751f\u7406\u8d1f\u8377\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u521d\u6b65\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u4f18\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u52a8\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditionally, social minds have been regarded as an exclusive property of living beings. Although large language models (LLMs) are widely accepted as powerful approximations of human behavior, with multi-LLM system being extensively explored to enhance their capabilities, it remains controversial whether they can be meaningfully compared to human social minds. In this work, we explore neural synchrony between socially interacting LLMs as an empirical evidence for this debate. Specifically, we introduce neural synchrony during social simulations as a novel proxy for analyzing the sociality of LLMs at the representational level. Through carefully designed experiments, we demonstrate that it reliably reflects both social engagement and temporal alignment in their interactions. Our findings indicate that neural synchrony between LLMs is strongly correlated with their social performance, highlighting an important link between neural synchrony and the social behaviors of LLMs. Our work offers a new perspective to examine the \"social minds\" of LLMs, highlighting surprising parallels in the internal dynamics that underlie human and LLM social interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u201c\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u201d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5728\u4e92\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u60ca\u4eba\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5df2\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u62e5\u6709\u201c\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u667a\u201d\u4ecd\u6709\u4e89\u8bae\u3002\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u65f6\u5927\u8111\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u540c\u6b65\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5e0c\u671b\u501f\u6b64\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u95f4\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u4f9d\u636e\u8003\u5bdf\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u62dfLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\uff08\u5373LLMs\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u9896\u5206\u6790\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6765\u6d4b\u5b9a\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7b49\u4e92\u52a8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u793e\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cLLM\u95f4\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u663e\u8457\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u53c2\u4e0e\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u534f\u540c\u6027\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u4e0eLLM\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u540c\u6b65\u80fd\u591f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u63ed\u793a\u548c\u91cf\u5316LLM\u7684\u201c\u793e\u4f1a\u5fc3\u667a\u201d\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u5185\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u4e92\u52a8\u5b58\u5728\u60ca\u4eba\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While effective, these modules introduce significant architectural complexity and computational overhead. Recent studies suggest that plain Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders, when scaled with sufficient capacity and large-scale pre-training, can conduct accurate image segmentation without requiring specialized modules. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT), a simple encoder-only video segmentation model that eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules. To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames by reusing queries from the previous frame. To balance this with adaptability to new content, it employs a query fusion strategy that combines the propagated queries with a set of temporally-agnostic learned queries. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity, achieving competitive accuracy while being 5x--10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

Existing speech enhancement solutions primarly rely on advanced digital signal processing techniques, deep learning methods, or complex software optimization techniques. This paper introduces a novel enhancement strategy that incorporates a physical optimization stage by dynamically modifying the geometry of a microphone array to adapt to changing acoustic conditions. A sixteen-microphone array is mounted on a robotic arm manipulator with seven degrees of freedom, with microphones divided into four groups of four, including one group positioned near the end-effector. The system reconfigures the array by adjusting the manipulator joint angles to place the end-effector microphones closer to the target speaker, thereby improving the reference signal quality. This proposed method integrates sound source localization techniques, computer vision, inverse kinematics, minimum variance distortionless response beamformer and time-frequency masking using a deep neural network.

The task has been primarily studied in the context of text and image retrieval, whereas QPP for content-based video retrieval (CBVR) remains largely underexplored. To this end, we propose the first benchmark for video query performance prediction (VQPP), comprising two text-to-video retrieval datasets and two CBVR systems, respectively. VQPP contains a total of 56K text queries and 51K videos, and comes with official training, validation and test splits, fostering direct comparisons and reproducible results. We explore multiple pre-retrieval and post-retrieval performance predictors, creating a representative benchmark for future exploration of QPP in the video domain. Our results show that pre-retrieval predictors obtain competitive performance, enabling applications before performing the retrieval step. We also demonstrate the applicability of VQPP by employing the best performing pre-retrieval predictor as reward model for training a large language model (LLM) on the query reformulation task via direct preference optimization (DPO).

Portions of this work were published at the ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild (see arXiv:2505.22637)", "summary": "Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling language model behavior by adding a learned bias to the activations at inference time. Although effective on average, steering effect sizes vary across samples and are unreliable for many target behaviors. In my thesis, I investigate why steering reliability differs across behaviors and how it is impacted by steering vector training data. First, I find that higher cosine similarity between training activation differences predicts more reliable steering. Second, I observe that behavior datasets where positive and negative activations are better separated along the steering direction are more reliably steerable. Finally, steering vectors trained on different prompt variations are directionally distinct, yet perform similarly well and exhibit correlated efficacy across datasets. My findings suggest that steering vectors are unreliable when the latent target behavior representation is not effectively approximated by the linear steering direction. Taken together, these insights offer a practical diagnostic for steering unreliability and motivate the development of more robust steering methods that explicitly account for non-linear latent behavior representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u201cSteering vectors\u201d\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u4ea7\u751f\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u5065\u58ee\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u53d1\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136steering vectors\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u60f3\u63a2\u7a76\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5185\u5728\u539f\u56e0\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0esteering\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5185\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5728steering\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u6027\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0d\u540cprompt\u53d8\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f97\u5230\u7684steering vector\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5dee\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0csteering\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\uff1b2\uff09\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u66f4\u6613\u53ef\u9760steering\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0d\u540cprompt\u4ea7\u751f\u7684steering vector\u867d\u65b9\u5411\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u6027\u80fd\u7c7b\u4f3c\uff1b4\uff09\u5f53\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u65e0\u6cd5\u88ab\u7ebf\u6027\u65b9\u5411\u826f\u597d\u903c\u8fd1\u65f6\uff0csteering\u6613\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5224\u65adsteering\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fasteering\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u9002\u914d\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u7814\u53d1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u66f4\u5065\u58ee\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a novel approach to construct semantically-grounded soft label targets using Language Models (LMs) by projecting the next token probabilities, conditioned on a specialized prompt, onto a pre-defined vocabulary to obtain contextually enriched supervision signals. By training the topic models to reconstruct the soft labels using the LM hidden states, our method produces higher-quality topics that are more closely aligned with the underlying thematic structure of the corpus. Experiments on three datasets show that our method achieves substantial improvements in topic coherence, purity over existing baselines.

However, the inherently redundant nature of video sequences poses significant challenges for contemporary state-of-the-art models. These challenges stem from two primary aspects: 1) efficiently incorporating a larger number of frames within memory constraints, and 2) extracting discriminative information from the vast volume of input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end schema for long-form video understanding, which includes an information-density-based adaptive video sampler (AVS) and an autoencoder-based spatiotemporal video compressor (SVC) integrated with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our proposed system offers two major advantages: it adaptively and effectively captures essential information from video sequences of varying durations, and it achieves high compression rates while preserving crucial discriminative information. The proposed framework demonstrates promising performance across various benchmarks, excelling in both long-form video understanding tasks and standard video understanding benchmarks. These results underscore the versatility and efficacy of our approach, particularly in managing the complexities of prolonged video sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5197\u4f59\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u957f\u51e0\u5341\u5206\u949f\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a(1) \u5728\u6709\u9650\u5185\u5b58\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u7eb3\u5165\u66f4\u591a\u5e27\uff1b(2) \u5728\u6d77\u91cf\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u5224\u522b\u529b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\uff08AVS\uff09\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff08SVC\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u8005\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u6df1\u5ea6\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\u3002AVS\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0cSVC\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4f46\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u957f\u3001\u591a\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u4f73\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing benchmarks do not evaluate such conditional reasoning, and retrieval-augmented or graph-based methods lack explicit mechanisms to ensure that retrieved knowledge is applicable to given context. To address this gap, we propose CondMedQA, the first benchmark for conditional biomedical QA, consisting of multi-hop questions whose answers vary with patient conditions. Furthermore, we propose Condition-Gated Reasoning (CGR), a novel framework that constructs condition-aware knowledge graphs and selectively activates or prunes reasoning paths based on query conditions. Our findings show that CGR more reliably selects condition-appropriate answers while matching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance on biomedical QA benchmarks, highlighting the importance of explicitly modeling conditionality for robust medical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CondMedQA\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Condition-Gated Reasoning(CGR)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5177\u4f53\u75c5\u4eba\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002CGR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u5047\u5b9a\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u9002\u7528\u7684\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u51b3\u7b56\u90fd\u8981\u8003\u8651\u75c5\u4eba\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u5408\u5e76\u75c7\u3001\u7981\u5fcc\u75c7\uff09\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86CondMedQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u8df3\u3001\u7b54\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u75c5\u4eba\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u51faCGR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u5907\u75c5\u4eba\u6761\u4ef6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6216\u526a\u679d\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCGR\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u7b26\u5408\u5177\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5904\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CondMedQA\u4e0eCGR\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

These improvements are evident in a wide range of VLMs built on a variety of base models, alignment architectures, and training data. However, recent works show that these models trail behind in traditional image classification benchmarks, which test fine-grained visual knowledge. We test a large number of recent VLMs on fine-grained classification benchmarks and identify potential factors in the disconnect between fine-grained knowledge and other vision benchmarks. Through a series of ablation experiments, we find that using a better LLM improves all benchmark scores equally, while a better vision encoder disproportionately improves fine-grained classification performance. Furthermore, we find that the pretraining stage is also vital to fine-grained performance, particularly when the language model weights are unfrozen during pretraining.

Enabled by probabilistic motion models, one may solve this problem by exploring the belief space of all trajectory predictions given future sensing actions to maximise information gain. However, for multi-modal motion models the notion of information gain is often ill-defined. This paper proposes a planning approach designed around maximising information regarding the target's homotopy class, or high-level motion. We introduce homotopic information gain, a measure of the expected high-level trajectory information given by a measurement. We show that homotopic information gain is a lower bound for metric or low-level information gain, and is as sparsely distributed in the environment as obstacles are. Planning sensing trajectories to maximise homotopic information results in highly accurate trajectory estimates with fewer measurements than a metric information approach, as supported by our empirical evaluation on real and simulated pedestrian data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e3b\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u540c\u4f26\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76ee\u6807\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u96be\u4ee5\u5408\u7406\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u8003\u8651\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u540c\u4f26\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u201c\u540c\u4f26\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u201d\uff0c\u5373\u9488\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u671f\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4e3a\u5ea6\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5212\u4f7f\u611f\u77e5\u52a8\u4f5c\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u5927\u540c\u4f26\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u53ca\u4eff\u771f\u884c\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5ea6\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u89c2\u6d4b\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6700\u5927\u5316\u540c\u4f26\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u5ea6\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u7aef\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002"}}

This paper presents the first systematic comparison of instruction optimization, based on the DSPy optimization framework, for tabular fact verification. We evaluate four out-of-the-box prompting techniques that cover both text-only prompting and code use: direct prediction, Chain-of-Thought (CoT), ReAct with SQL tools, and CodeAct with Python execution. We study three optimizers from the DSPy framework -- COPRO, MiPROv2, and SIMBA -- across four benchmarks and three model families. We find that instruction optimization consistently improves verification accuracy, with MiPROv2 yielding the most stable gains for CoT, and SIMBA providing the largest benefits for ReAct agents, particularly at larger model scales. Behavioral analyses reveal that SIMBA encourages more direct reasoning paths by applying heuristics, thereby improving numerical comparison abilities in CoT reasoning and helping avoid unnecessary tool calls in ReAct agents. Across different prompting techniques, CoT remains effective for tabular fact checking, especially with smaller models.

However, in practice, the quality and consistency of the synthesized views are fundamentally limited by the reliability of the underlying depth estimates, which are often fragile under low texture, adverse weather, and occlusion-heavy real-world conditions. In this work, we show that incorporating sparse multimodal range measurements provides a simple yet effective way to overcome these limitations. We introduce a multimodal depth reconstruction framework that leverages extremely sparse range sensing data, such as automotive radar or LiDAR, to produce dense depth maps that serve as robust geometric conditioning for diffusion-based novel view synthesis. Our approach models depth in an angular domain using a localized Gaussian Process formulation, enabling computationally efficient inference while explicitly quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited observations. The reconstructed depth and uncertainty are used as a drop-in replacement for monocular depth estimators in existing diffusion-based rendering pipelines, without modifying the generative model itself. Experiments on real-world multimodal driving scenes demonstrate that replacing vision-only depth with our sparse range-based reconstruction substantially improves both geometric consistency and visual quality in single-image novel-view video generation. These results highlight the importance of reliable geometric priors for diffusion-based view synthesis and demonstrate the practical benefits of multimodal sensing even at extreme levels of sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6781\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\uff08\u5982\u96f7\u8fbe\u6216\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u76ee\u4f30\u6df1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff08\u5982\u4f4e\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u906e\u6321\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6781\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u96f7\u8fbe\u6216\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u89d2\u57df\u4e0a\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\u540c\u65f6\u91cf\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u91cd\u5efa\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u66ff\u6362\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6e32\u67d3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u6539\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u6df1\u5ea6\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u6240\u63d0\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u89c2\u611f\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u4f20\u611f\u6781\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u4e5f\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u660e\u663e\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Iterative learning control (ILC) improves performance by using information from previous iterations to compensate for expected errors in future iterations. This work incorporates the use of Quasi-Periodic Gaussian Processes (QPGPs) into a predictive ILC framework to model and forecast disturbances and drift across iterations. Using a recent structural equation formulation of QPGPs, the proposed approach enables efficient inference with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(p^3)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}(i^2p^3)$, where $p$ denotes the number of points within an iteration and $i$ represents the total number of iterations, specially for larger $i$. This formulation also enables parameter estimation without loss of information, making continual GP learning computationally feasible within the control loop. By predicting next-iteration error profiles rather than relying only on past errors, the controller achieves faster convergence and maintains this under time-varying disturbances. We benchmark the method against both standard ILC and conventional Gaussian Process (GP)-based predictive ILC on three tasks, autonomous vehicle trajectory tracking, a three-link robotic manipulator, and a real-world Stretch robot experiment.

Results Across all concepts, CUICurate produced substantially larger and more complete concept sets than the manual benchmarks whilst matching human precision. Comparisons between the two LLMs found that GPT-5-mini achieved higher recall during filtering, while GPT-5 produced classifications that more closely aligned with clinician judgements. Outputs were stable across repeated runs and computationally inexpensive. Conclusions CUICurate offers a scalable and reproducible approach to support UMLS concept set curation that substantially reduces manual effort. By integrating graph-based retrieval with LLM reasoning, the framework produces focused candidate concept sets that can be adapted to clinical NLP pipelines for different phenotyping and analytic requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CUICurate\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u81ea\u52a8UMLS\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4eba\u5de5\u52b3\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u5de5\u5177\u53ea\u80fd\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5355\u4e2aUMLS\u6982\u5ff5\uff08CUI\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8bb8\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u7ec4\u76f8\u5173\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u3001\u5b50\u7c7b\u548c\u8d85\u7c7b\uff09\u3002\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6574\u7406\u3002\u8fd9\u6210\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86UMLS\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u5019\u9009CUI\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u518d\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GPT-5\u548cGPT-5-mini\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "CUICurate\u6846\u67b6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u6bd4\u4eba\u5de5\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u5168\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5ea6\u3002GPT-5-mini\u5728\u5019\u9009\u7b5b\u9009\u4e2d\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0cGPT-5\u5206\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "CUICurate\u5927\u5e45\u7b80\u5316\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e86UMLS\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8aNLP\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u8868\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u53ca\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u9002\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5206\u6790\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Code and models available at https://github.com/Bluesman79/ZACH-ViT", "summary": "Vision Transformers rely on positional embeddings and class tokens that encode fixed spatial priors. While effective for natural images, these priors may hinder generalization when spatial layout is weakly informative or inconsistent, a frequent condition in medical imaging and edge-deployed clinical systems. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a compact Vision Transformer that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, achieving permutation invariance through global average pooling over patch representations. The term \"Zero-token\" specifically refers to removing the dedicated [CLS] aggregation token and positional embeddings; patch tokens remain unchanged and are processed normally. Adaptive residual projections preserve training stability in compact configurations while maintaining a strict parameter budget.\n  Evaluation is performed across seven MedMNIST datasets spanning binary and multi-class tasks under a strict few-shot protocol (50 samples per class, fixed hyperparameters, five random seeds). The empirical analysis demonstrates regime-dependent behavior: ZACH-ViT (0.25M parameters, trained from scratch) achieves its strongest advantage on BloodMNIST and remains competitive with TransMIL on PathMNIST, while its relative advantage decreases on datasets with strong anatomical priors (OCTMNIST, OrganAMNIST), consistent with the architectural hypothesis. These findings support the view that aligning architectural inductive bias with data structure can be more important than pursuing universal benchmark dominance. Despite its minimal size and lack of pretraining, ZACH-ViT achieves competitive performance while maintaining sub-second inference times, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.

Project page: https://ai4ce.github.io/EgoPush/", "summary": "Humans can rearrange objects in cluttered environments using egocentric perception, navigating occlusions without global coordinates. Inspired by this capability, we study long-horizon multi-object non-prehensile rearrangement for mobile robots using a single egocentric camera. We introduce EgoPush, a policy learning framework that enables egocentric, perception-driven rearrangement without relying on explicit global state estimation that often fails in dynamic scenes. EgoPush designs an object-centric latent space to encode relative spatial relations among objects, rather than absolute poses. This design enables a privileged reinforcement-learning (RL) teacher to jointly learn latent states and mobile actions from sparse keypoints, which is then distilled into a purely visual student policy. To reduce the supervision gap between the omniscient teacher and the partially observed student, we restrict the teacher's observations to visually accessible cues. This induces active perception behaviors that are recoverable from the student's viewpoint. To address long-horizon credit assignment, we decompose rearrangement into stage-level subproblems using temporally decayed, stage-local completion rewards. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that EgoPush significantly outperforms end-to-end RL baselines in success rate, with ablation studies validating each design choice. We further demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a mobile platform in the real world.

We study a frequent failure mode in which the correct document is retrieved but the page or chunk that contains the answer is missed, leading the generator to extrapolate from incomplete context. Despite its practical significance, this within-document retrieval failure mode has received limited systematic attention in the Financial Question Answering (QA) literature. We evaluate retrieval at multiple levels of granularity, document, page, and chunk level, and introduce an oracle based analysis to provide empirical upper bounds on retrieval and generative performance. On a 150 question subset of FinanceBench, we reproduce and compare diverse retrieval strategies including dense, sparse, hybrid, and hierarchical methods with reranking and query reformulation. Across methods, gains in document discovery tend to translate into stronger page recall, yet oracle performance still suggests headroom for page and chunk level retrieval. To target this gap, we introduce a domain fine-tuned page scorer that treats pages as an intermediate retrieval unit between documents and chunks. Unlike prior passage-based hierarchical retrieval, we fine-tune a bi-encoder specifically for page-level relevance on financial filings, exploiting the semantic coherence of pages. Overall, our results demonstrate a significant improvement in page recall and chunk retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u957f\u7bc7\u6cd5\u89c4\u95ee\u7b54\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c55\u5f00\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u9875\u9762\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u91d1\u878d\u6cd5\u89c4\u6587\u4ef6\u7bc7\u5e45\u957f\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u6587\u6863\u540e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u542b\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u9875\u9762\u6216\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u7c7b\u6587\u6863\u5185\u68c0\u7d22\u5931\u8d25\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u91d1\u878d\u95ee\u7b54\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u6587\u732e\u8f83\u5c11\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ec6\u81f4\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5728FinanceBench\u95ee\u7b54\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7a20\u5bc6\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u53ca\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9875\u9762\u7ea7\u6253\u5206\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u9875\u9762\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u6863\u548c\u7247\u6bb5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u5355\u5143\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u6587\u4ef6\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9875\u9762\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408oracle\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u6781\u9650\u63d0\u4f9b\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6587\u6863\u5c42\u68c0\u7d22\u8fdb\u6b65\u867d\u5e26\u52a8\u9875\u9762\u53ec\u56de\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u9875\u9762\u53ca\u7247\u6bb5\u5c42\u4ecd\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u5fae\u8c03\u9875\u9762\u7ea7\u6253\u5206\u5668\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9875\u9762\u548cchunk\uff08\u7247\u6bb5\uff09\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86RAG\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u7b54\u6848\u8bc1\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u6cd5\u89c4\u95ee\u7b54\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u9875\u9762\u7ea7\u68c0\u7d22\u5355\u5143\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57dfRAG\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

An effective approach is representation alignment, where a strong vision foundation model is used to guide a 2D VLA model. However, existing methods usually apply supervision at only a single layer, failing to fully exploit the rich information distributed across depth; meanwhile, na\u00efve multi-layer alignment can cause gradient interference. We introduce ROCKET, a residual-oriented multi-layer representation alignment framework that formulates multi-layer alignment as aligning one residual stream to another. Concretely, ROCKET employs a shared projector to align multiple layers of the VLA backbone with multiple layers of a powerful 3D vision foundation model via a layer-invariant mapping, which reduces gradient conflicts. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical analyses showing that a shared projector is sufficient and outperforms prior designs, and further propose a Matryoshka-style sparse activation scheme for the shared projector to balance multiple alignment losses. Our experiments show that, combined with a training-free layer selection strategy, ROCKET requires only about 4% of the compute budget while achieving 98.5% state-of-the-art success rate on LIBERO. We further demonstrate the superior performance of ROCKET across LIBERO-Plus and RoboTwin, as well as multiple VLA models.

This manuscript was completed in 2020 as part of the first author's graduate thesis at Carnegie Mellon University", "summary": "In this paper, we present a framework for enabling autonomous vehicles to interact with cyclists in a manner that balances safety and optimality. The approach integrates Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis with deep Q-learning to jointly address safety guarantees and time-efficient navigation. A value function is computed as the solution to a time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman inequality, providing a quantitative measure of safety for each system state.

As AI systems evolve from static models to compound, tool-using agents, evaluation becomes a core control function. The question is no longer \"How good is the model?\" but \"Can we trust the system to behave as intended, under change, at scale?\". Yet most evaluation practices remain anchored in assumptions inherited from the model-centric era: static benchmarks, aggregate scores, and one-off success criteria. This paper argues that such approaches are increasingly obscure rather than illuminating system behavior. We examine how evaluation pipelines themselves introduce silent failure modes, why high benchmark scores routinely mislead teams, and how agentic systems fundamentally alter the meaning of performance measurement. Rather than proposing new metrics or harder benchmarks, we aim to clarify the role of evaluation in the AI era, and especially for agents: not as performance theater, but as a measurement discipline that conditions trust, iteration, and governance in non-deterministic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9010\u6b65\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u590d\u5408\u4f53\u540e\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5df2\u4ece\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6279\u8bc4\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u590d\u6742AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3b\u5f20\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5e94\u6210\u4e3a\u5efa\u7acb\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u805a\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u73b0\u4ee3\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684AI agent\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u968f\u7740AI \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u65ad\u8fdb\u5316\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u79d1\u5b66\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u5426\u88ab\u4fe1\u4efb\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e9f\u9700\u63a2\u8ba8\u7684\u65b0\u8bfe\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u9759\u9ed8\u5931\u8d25\u3001\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u5206\u6570\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u5bf9\u8bc4\u4f30\u672c\u8d28\u548c\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u518d\u601d\u8003\u3002\u5e76\u672a\u7740\u91cd\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5398\u6e05AI\u65f6\u4ee3\u3001\u7279\u522b\u662fagent\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u53d8\u9769\u3002", "result": "\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9762\u5411\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f53\u7cfb\u6613\u9690\u85cfagent\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9ad8\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0d\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u7cfb\u7edf\u771f\u5b9e\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5931\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f3a\u8c03\uff0cAI agent\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5e94\u518d\u662f\u5c55\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5267\u573a\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u8f6c\u578b\u4e3a\u4fdd\u969c\u4fe1\u4efb\u3001\u652f\u6301\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5b66\u79d1\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6c\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u6258\u7ba1\u548c\u7b26\u5408\u4f26\u7406\u6cbb\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

However, their performance is constrained by the quality of the reference image, which limits real-world applications where ideal reference sources are unavailable. Notably, the human visual system has the ability to accumulate visual memory, allowing image quality assessment on the basis of long-term memory storage. Inspired by this biological memory mechanism, we propose a memory-driven quality-aware framework (MQAF), which establishes a memory bank for storing distortion patterns and dynamically switches between dual-mode quality assessment strategies to reduce reliance on high-quality reference images. When reference images are available, MQAF obtains reference-guided quality scores by adaptively weighting reference information and comparing the distorted image with stored distortion patterns in the memory bank. When the reference image is absent, the framework relies on distortion patterns in the memory bank to infer image quality, enabling no-reference quality assessment (NR-IQA).

To date, no large-scale public legged-robot dataset captures the real-world conditions needed to develop and benchmark algorithms for legged-robot state estimation, perception, and navigation. To address this, we introduce the GrandTour dataset, a multi-modal legged-robotics dataset collected across challenging outdoor and indoor environments, featuring an ANYbotics ANYmal-D quadruped equipped with the \\boxi multi-modal sensor payload. GrandTour spans a broad range of environments and operational scenarios across distinct test sites, ranging from alpine scenery and forests to demolished buildings and urban areas, and covers a wide variation in scale, complexity, illumination, and weather conditions. The dataset provides time-synchronized sensor data from spinning LiDARs, multiple RGB cameras with complementary characteristics, proprioceptive sensors, and stereo depth cameras. Moreover, it includes high-precision ground-truth trajectories from satellite-based RTK-GNSS and a Leica Geosystems total station.

Yet its effectiveness may depend on perceptions of its political neutrality. As LLMs enter partisan conflict, elites increasingly portray them as ideologically aligned. We test whether these credibility attacks reduce LLM-based persuasion. In a preregistered U.S. survey experiment (N=2144), participants completed a three-round conversation with ChatGPT about a personally held economic policy misconception. Compared to a neutral control, a short message indicating that the LLM was biased against the respondent's party attenuated persuasion by 28%. Transcript analysis indicates that the warnings alter the interaction: respondents push back more and engage less receptively. These findings suggest that the persuasive impact of conversational AI is politically contingent, constrained by perceptions of partisan alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f53\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u515a\u6d3e\u504f\u89c1\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u8bf4\u670d\u516c\u4f17\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u89c2\u70b9\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u7ea0\u6b63\u516c\u4f17\u8bef\u533a\u548c\u62b5\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5176\u653f\u6cbb\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u3002\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u88ab\u5377\u5165\u515a\u6d3e\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5176\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u503e\u5411\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u68c0\u9a8c\u9488\u5bf9\u5176\u516c\u4fe1\u529b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u662f\u5426\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u9884\u6ce8\u518c\u7684\u95ee\u5377\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08N=2144\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e09\u8f6eChatGPT\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u7ea0\u6b63\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u7ecf\u6d4e\u653f\u7b56\u8bef\u533a\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u53e5\u201c\u8be5AI\u5bf9\u60a8\u7684\u653f\u515a\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u201d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5bf9\u7167\u7ec4\uff08\u6ca1\u6709\u8be5\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u9192AI\u5b58\u5728\u515a\u6d3e\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f7f\u8bf4\u670d\u7387\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8628%\u3002\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63a5\u6536\u5230\u504f\u89c1\u8b66\u544a\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u53cd\u9a73AI\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0fAI\u7684\u8bf4\u670d\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5176\u653f\u6cbb\u4e2d\u7acb\u6027\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u5f71\u54cd\u8f83\u5927\u3002\u5982\u679c\u7528\u6237\u8ba4\u4e3aAI\u6709\u515a\u6d3e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5176\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u4f1a\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002"}}

We introduce MUOT_3M, the first pseudo multimodal UOT benchmark comprising 3 million frames from 3,030 videos (27.8h) annotated with 32 tracking attributes, 677 fine grained classes, and synchronized RGB, estimated enhanced RGB, estimated depth, and language modalities validated by a marine biologist. Building upon MUOT_3M, we propose MUTrack, a SAM-based multimodal to unimodal tracker featuring visual geometric alignment, vision language fusion, and four level knowledge distillation that transfers multimodal knowledge into a unimodal student model. Extensive evaluations across five UOT benchmarks demonstrate that MUTrack achieves up to 8.40% higher AUC and 7.80% higher precision than the strongest SOTA baselines while running at 24 FPS.

The ScaleMaster Dataset and Benchmark", "comment": "8 pages, 9 figures, accepted to ICRA 2026", "summary": "Recent advances in deep monocular visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) have achieved impressive accuracy and dense reconstruction capabilities, yet their robustness to scale inconsistency in large-scale indoor environments remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks are limited to room-scale or structurally simple settings, leaving critical issues of intra-session scale drift and inter-session scale ambiguity insufficiently addressed. To fill this gap, we introduce the ScaleMaster Dataset, the first benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate scale consistency under challenging scenarios such as multi-floor structures, long trajectories, repetitive views, and low-texture regions. We systematically analyze the vulnerability of state-of-the-art deep monocular visual SLAM systems to scale inconsistency, providing both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Crucially, our analysis extends beyond traditional trajectory metrics to include a direct map-to-map quality assessment using metrics like Chamfer distance against high-fidelity 3D ground truth. Our results reveal that while recent deep monocular visual SLAM systems demonstrate strong performance on existing benchmarks, they suffer from severe scale-related failures in realistic, large-scale indoor environments. By releasing the ScaleMaster dataset and baseline results, we aim to establish a foundation for future research toward developing scale-consistent and reliable visual SLAM systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5ba4\u5185\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6ScaleMaster\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u6df1\u5ea6\u5355\u76eeSLAM\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5c0f\u573a\u666f\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5ba4\u5185\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3b\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u624b\u6bb5\u65e0\u6cd5\u66b4\u9732\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86ScaleMaster\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u5c42\u3001\u591a\u56de\u8def\u3001\u4f4e\u7eb9\u7406\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5730\u56fe\u5bf9\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982Chamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u6df1\u5ea6\u5355\u76eeSLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u6df1\u5ea6\u5355\u76eeSLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5c0f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728ScaleMaster\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "ScaleMaster\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5355\u76eeSLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5927\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u89c6\u89c9SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

There is growing interest in fine-tuning these models for such domains; however, progress is constrained by the scarcity and limited coverage of high-quality, task-relevant data. To address this, synthetic data generation methods such as paraphrasing or knowledge extraction are commonly applied. Although these approaches excel at factual recall and conceptual knowledge, they suffer from two critical shortcomings: (i) they provide minimal support for interpretive reasoning capabilities in these specialized domains, and (ii) they often produce synthetic corpora that are excessively large and redundant, resulting in poor sample efficiency. To overcome these gaps, we propose an adversarial question-generation framework that produces a compact set of semantically challenging questions. These questions are constructed by comparing the outputs of the model to be adapted and a robust expert model grounded in reference documents, using an iterative, feedback-driven process designed to reveal and address comprehension gaps. Evaluation on specialized subsets of the LegalBench corpus demonstrates that our method achieves greater accuracy with substantially fewer synthetic samples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u867d\u7136\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u6599\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u91ca\u4e49\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u62bd\u53d6\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6837\u672c\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u6297\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u5f85\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53c2\u8003\u6587\u6863\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8f93\u51fa\u6bd4\u5bf9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d41\u7a0b\u81ea\u52a8\u63ed\u793a\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u9886\u57df\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u95ee\u9898\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6LegalBench\u7684\u4e13\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57dfLLM\u5fae\u8c03\u96be\u70b9\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

With this in mind, this paper proposes an LLM-centric Affective Visual Customization (L-AVC) task, which focuses on generating images within modifying their subjective emotions via Multimodal LLM. Further, this paper contends that how to make the model efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics (named inter-emotion semantic conversion) and how to precisely retain emotion-agnostic contents (named exter-emotion semantic retaining) are rather important and challenging in this L-AVC task. To this end, this paper proposes an Efficient and Precise Emotion Manipulating approach for editing subjective emotions in images. Specifically, an Efficient Inter-emotion Converting (EIC) module is tailored to make the LLM efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics before and after editing, followed by a Precise Exter-emotion Retaining (PER) module to precisely retain the emotion-agnostic contents. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on our constructed L-AVC dataset demonstrate the great advantage of the proposed EPEM approach to the L-AVC task over several state-of-the-art baselines.

This work addresses these constraints through a volume-optimized spindle-shaped angled actuator (SSAA) geometry: by reducing actuator volume by 35.7% (357mL vs. 555mL), the SSAA maintains 94.2% of output torque while achieving 35.2% faster dynamic response compared to uniform cylindrical designs. Building on the SSAA, we develop a curved abduction actuator (CAA) based on the SSAA geometry and a horizontal adduction actuator (HAA) based on the pouch motor principle, integrating both into a dual-DOF textile-based shoulder exosuit (390 g). The exosuit delivers multi-modal assistance spanning shoulder abduction, flexion, and horizontal adduction, depending on the actuation.\n  User studies with 10 healthy participants reveal that the exosuit substantially reduces electromyographic (EMG) activity across both shoulder abduction and flexion tasks. For abduction with HAA only, the exosuit achieved up to 59% muscle activity reduction across seven muscles. For flexion, both the single-actuator configuration (HAA only) and the dual-actuator configuration (HAA,+,CAA) reduced EMG activity by up to 63.7% compared to no assistance. However, the incremental benefit of adding the CAA to existing HAA support was limited in healthy users during flexion, with statistically significant additional reductions observed only in pectoralis major. These experimental findings characterize actuator contributions in healthy users and provide design guidance for multi-DOF exosuit systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u8f7b\u4fbf\u4e24\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8f6f\u4f53\u80a9\u90e8\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u65b0\u578b\u6c14\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u80a9\u90e8\u76f8\u5173\u808c\u7fa4\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u80a9\u90e8\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u4f5c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u626d\u77e9\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f53\u79ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7eba\u9524\u5f62\u503e\u89d2\u6c14\u52a8\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff08SSAA\uff09\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u4f53\u79ef\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u626d\u77e9\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\n2. \u57fa\u4e8eSSAA\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u66f2\u7ebf\u5916\u5c55\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff08CAA\uff09\u548c\u6c34\u5e73\u5185\u6536\u6267\u884c\u5668\uff08HAA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5165\u53cc\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7eba\u7ec7\u57fa\u80a9\u90e8\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u3002\n3. \u901a\u8fc7\u5bf910\u540d\u5065\u5eb7\u5fd7\u613f\u8005\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u808c\u7535EMG\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5bf9\u80a9\u90e8\u76f8\u5173\u808c\u7fa4\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u578bSSAA\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5706\u67f1\u6267\u884c\u5668\u4f53\u79ef\u51cf\u5c1135.7%\uff0c\u4f46\u4fdd\u630194.2%\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u626d\u77e9\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534735.2%\u3002\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u5728\u80a9\u5916\u5c55\u548c\u5c48\u66f2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u76ee\u6807\u808c\u7fa459%-63.7%\u7684EMG\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u53cc\u6267\u884c\u5668\u5bf9\u5c48\u66f2\u589e\u76ca\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u80f8\u5927\u808c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u901a\u8fc7\u4f53\u79ef\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6c14\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f7b\u4fbf\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u8f6f\u4f53\u80a9\u90e8\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5065\u5eb7\u4eba\u7fa4\u76f8\u5173\u808c\u7fa4\u8d1f\u8377\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5916\u9aa8\u9abc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4f9d\u636e\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Prior work has explored intrinsic signals available during generation, among which attention offers a direct view of grounding behavior. However, existing approaches typically rely on coarse summaries that fail to capture fine-grained instabilities in attention. Inspired by signal processing, we introduce a frequency-aware perspective on attention by analyzing its variation during generation. We model attention distributions as discrete signals and extract high-frequency components that reflect rapid local changes in attention. Our analysis reveals that hallucinated tokens are associated with high-frequency attention energy, reflecting fragmented and unstable grounding behavior. Based on this insight, we develop a lightweight hallucination detector using high-frequency attention features.

Motivated by these gaps, this paper introduces a new chat paradigm SVU task, i.e., In-depth Security-oriented Video Understanding (DeepSVU), which aims to not only identify and locate the threats but also attribute and evaluate the causes threatening segments. Furthermore, this paper reveals two key challenges in the proposed task: 1) how to effectively model the coarse-to-fine physical-world information (e.g., human behavior, object interactions and background context) to boost the DeepSVU task; and 2) how to adaptively trade off these factors. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a new Unified Physical-world Regularized MoE (UPRM) approach. Specifically, UPRM incorporates two key components: the Unified Physical-world Enhanced MoE (UPE) Block and the Physical-world Trade-off Regularizer (PTR), to address the above two challenges, respectively. Extensive experiments conduct on our DeepSVU instructions datasets (i.e., UCF-C instructions and CUVA instructions) demonstrate that UPRM outperforms several advanced Video-LLMs as well as non-VLM approaches.

The field has rapidly evolved with additional spatial priors and diverse architectural innovations. However, these advancements are often accompanied by varying training recipes and implementation details, which can make it challenging to disentangle the precise source of empirical gains. In this work, we introduce SimVLA, a streamlined baseline designed to establish a transparent reference point for VLA research. By strictly decoupling perception from control, using a standard vision-language backbone and a lightweight action head, and standardizing critical training dynamics, we demonstrate that a minimal design can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Despite having only 0.5B parameters, SimVLA outperforms multi-billion-parameter models on standard simulation benchmarks without robot pretraining.

Here we show that lossless compression provides a simple, model-agnostic measure of statistical regularity that differentiates generative regimes directly from surface text. We analyze compression behavior across three progressively more complex information ecosystems: controlled human-LLM continuations, generative mediation of a knowledge infrastructure (Wikipedia vs. Grokipedia), and fully synthetic social interaction environments (Moltbook vs. Reddit). Across settings, compression reveals a persistent structural signature of probabilistic generation. In controlled and mediated contexts, LLM-produced language exhibits higher structural regularity and compressibility than human-written text, consistent with a concentration of output within highly recurrent statistical patterns. However, this signature shows scale dependence: in fragmented interaction environments the separation attenuates, suggesting a fundamental limit to surface-level distinguishability at small scales. This compressibility-based separation emerges consistently across models, tasks, and domains and can be observed directly from surface text without relying on model internals or semantic evaluation.

To enhance performance, existing methods often incorporate extra observation cues (e.g., depth maps, point clouds) or auxiliary modules (e.g., object detectors, encoders) to enable more precise and reliable task execution, yet these typically require costly data collection and additional training. Inspired by the finding that Feed-Forward Network (FFN) in language models can act as \"key-value memory\", we propose Uncertainty-aware Observation Reinjection (UAOR), an effective, training-free and plug-and-play module for VLA models. Specifically, when the current language model layer exhibits high uncertainty, measured by Action Entropy, it reinjects key observation information into the next layer's Feed-Forward Network (FFN) through attention retrieval. This mechanism helps VLAs better attend to observations during inference, enabling more confident and faithful action generation. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently improves diverse VLA models across simulation and real-world tasks with minimal overhead. Notably, UAOR eliminates the need for additional observation cues or modules, making it a versatile and practical plug-in for existing VLA pipelines.

While lines can constitute a robust intermediate representation that is consistently observed, the sparse nature of lines may lead to drastic deterioration with minor estimation errors. Only a few previous works, often accompanied by additional sensors, utilize lines to compensate for the severe domain discrepancies of event sensors along with unpredictable noise characteristics. We propose a method that can stably extract tracks of varying appearances of lines using a clever algorithmic process that observes multiple representations from various time slices of events, compensating for potential adversaries within the event data. We then propose geometric cost functions that can refine the 3D line maps and camera poses, eliminating projective distortions and depth ambiguities. The 3D line maps are highly compact and can be equipped with our proposed cost function, which can be adapted for any observations that can detect and extract line structures or projections of them, including 3D point cloud maps or image observations. We demonstrate that our formulation is powerful enough to exhibit a significant performance boost in event-based mapping and pose refinement across diverse datasets, and can be flexibly applied to multimodal scenarios. Our results confirm that the proposed line-based formulation is a robust and effective approach for the practical deployment of event-based perceptual modules.

VLMs are particularly vulnerable because they process both text and images, creating broader attack surfaces. However, available resources for jailbreak detection are scarce, particularly in finance. To address this gap, we present FENCE, a bilingual (Korean-English) multimodal dataset for training and evaluating jailbreak detectors in financial applications. FENCE emphasizes domain realism through finance-relevant queries paired with image-grounded threats. Experiments with commercial and open-source VLMs reveal consistent vulnerabilities, with GPT-4o showing measurable attack success rates and open-source models displaying greater exposure. A baseline detector trained on FENCE achieves 99 percent in-distribution accuracy and maintains strong performance on external benchmarks, underscoring the dataset's robustness for training reliable detection models. FENCE provides a focused resource for advancing multimodal jailbreak detection in finance and for supporting safer, more reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Existing attention manipulation methods focus exclusively on the Key space to modulate attention routing, leaving the Value space -- which governs feature aggregation -- entirely unexploited. In this paper, we first reveal that both Key and Value projections in DiT's multi-modal attention layers exhibit a pronounced bias-delta structure, where token embeddings cluster tightly around a layer-specific bias vector. Building on this observation, we propose Dual-Channel Attention Guidance (DCAG), a training-free framework that simultaneously manipulates both the Key channel (controlling where to attend) and the Value channel (controlling what to aggregate). We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the Key channel operates through the nonlinear softmax function, acting as a coarse control knob, while the Value channel operates through linear weighted summation, serving as a fine-grained complement. Together, the two-dimensional parameter space $(\u03b4_k, \u03b4_v)$ enables more precise editing-fidelity trade-offs than any single-channel method. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark (700 images, 10 editing categories) demonstrate that DCAG consistently outperforms Key-only guidance across all fidelity metrics, with the most significant improvements observed in localized editing tasks such as object deletion (4.9% LPIPS reduction) and object addition (3.2% LPIPS reduction).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236Key\u4e0eValue\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5DCAG\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eDiT\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4fee\u6539\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42Key\u901a\u9053\u4ee5\u8c03\u6574\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b8c\u5168\u5ffd\u7565Value\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u53d1\u73b0DiT\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u7684Key\u548cValue\u6295\u5f71\u90fd\u5448\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u7684bias-delta\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u51faDual-Channel Attention Guidance (DCAG)\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u540c\u65f6\u64cd\u7eb5Key\uff08\u51b3\u5b9a\u5173\u6ce8\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\u548cValue\uff08\u51b3\u5b9a\u805a\u5408\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574($\u03b4_k, \u03b4_v$)\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eKey\u4ee5softmax\u5e26\u6765\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800cValue\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728PIE-Bench\uff08700\u56fe\uff0c10\u7f16\u8f91\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cDCAG\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4ec5Key\u8c03\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u5bf9\u8c61\u5220\u9664\u548c\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0cLPIPS\u6307\u6807\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e864.9%\u548c3.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "DCAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u8c03\u63a7Key\u4e0eValue\u901a\u9053\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional methods with fixed leaders or rigid formation roles, the proposed approach integrates dynamic role assignment and partial goal planning, enabling flexible, collision-free navigation in complex scenarios. Formation stability and inter-robot safety are ensured through a virtual spring-damper system coupled with a novel obstacle avoidance layer that adaptively adjusts each agent's velocity. A dynamic look-ahead reference generator further enhances flexibility, allowing temporary formation deformation to maneuver around obstacles while maintaining goal-directed motion. The Fast Marching Square (FM2) algorithm provides the global path for the leader and local paths for the followers as the planning backbone.

Recent works typically apply semantically coarse category names as auxiliary contexts to guide the learning of discriminative visual features. However, such context provided by the action names is too limited to provide sufficient background knowledge for capturing novel spatial and temporal concepts in actions. In this paper, we propose DiST, an innovative Decomposition-incorporation framework for FSAR that makes use of decoupled Spatial and Temporal knowledge provided by large language models to learn expressive multi-granularity prototypes. In the decomposition stage, we decouple vanilla action names into diverse spatio-temporal attribute descriptions (action-related knowledge). Such commonsense knowledge complements semantic contexts from spatial and temporal perspectives. In the incorporation stage, we propose Spatial/Temporal Knowledge Compensators (SKC/TKC) to discover discriminative object-level and frame-level prototypes, respectively. In SKC, object-level prototypes adaptively aggregate important patch tokens under the guidance of spatial knowledge. Moreover, in TKC, frame-level prototypes utilize temporal attributes to assist in inter-frame temporal relation modeling. These learned prototypes thus provide transparency in capturing fine-grained spatial details and diverse temporal patterns.

However, such policies often exploit unnatural high-frequency signals that are unachievable by humans or physical robots, making them poor representations of real-world behaviors. Existing work addresses this issue by adding a reward term that penalizes a large change in actions over time. This term often requires substantial tuning efforts. We propose to use the action Jacobian penalty, which penalizes changes in action with respect to the changes in simulated state directly through auto differentiation. This effectively eliminates unrealistic high-frequency control signals without task specific tuning. While effective, the action Jacobian penalty introduces significant computational overhead when used with traditional fully connected neural network architectures. To mitigate this, we introduce a new architecture called a Linear Policy Net (LPN) that significantly reduces the computational burden for calculating the action Jacobian penalty during training. In addition, a LPN requires no parameter tuning, exhibits faster learning convergence compared to baseline methods, and can be more efficiently queried during inference time compared to a fully connected neural network. We demonstrate that a Linear Policy Net, combined with the action Jacobian penalty, is able to learn policies that generate smooth signals while solving a number of motion imitation tasks with different characteristics, including dynamic motions such as a backflip and various challenging parkour skills.

Existing samplers typically adopt greedy heuristics, prioritizing positions with the highest local certainty to decode at each step. Through failure case analysis, we identify a fundamental limitation of this approach: it neglects the downstream impact of current decoding choices on subsequent steps and fails to minimize cumulative uncertainty. In particular, these methods do not fully exploit the non-causal nature of MDMs, which enables evaluating how a decoding decision reshapes token probabilities/uncertainty across all remaining masked positions. To bridge this gap, we propose the Info-Gain Sampler, a principled decoding framework that balances immediate uncertainty with information gain over future masked tokens. Extensive evaluations across diverse architectures and tasks (reasoning, coding, creative writing, and image generation) demonstrate that Info-Gain Sampler consistently outperforms existing samplers for MDMs. For instance, it achieves a 3.6% improvement in average accuracy on reasoning tasks and a 63.1% win-rate in creative writing. Notably, on reasoning tasks it reduces cumulative uncertainty from 78.4 to 48.6, outperforming the best baseline by a large margin.

A dispersion-adaptive metric learner adjusts instance-level margins according to feature spread, increasing intra-class compactness. Spatially conditioned attention injects coarse geometry, such as GPS or deployment floor plans, into graph-based self-attention to enable projectively consistent cross-view alignment using only coarse geometric priors without requiring survey-grade calibration. Differentially private embedding maps are coupled with compact approximate indexes to support secure and cost-efficient deployment. Together these designs produce descriptors robust to viewpoint variation, occlusion, and domain shifts, and they enable a tunable balance between privacy and utility under rigorous differential-privacy accounting.

In this study, a tendon-driven mechanism consisting of spiral-based metabeams was developed to exploit this principle for producing both reciprocating and non-reciprocating motion. The snapping structures were fabricated using fused deposition modeling with polylactic acid (PLA) and experimentally tested under different boundary conditions to analyze their nonlinear behavior. The results show that the mechanical characteristics, including critical forces and stability, can be tuned solely by adjusting the boundary constraints. The spiral geometry allows large reversible deformation even when made from a relatively stiff material such as PLA, providing a straightforward design concept for controllable snapping behavior. The developed mechanism was further integrated into a swimming robot, where tendon-driven fins exhibited two distinct actuation modes: reciprocating and non-reciprocating motion. The latter enabled efficient propulsion, producing a forward displacement of about 32 mm per 0.4 s cycle ($\\approx$ 81 mm/s, equivalent to 0.4 body lengths per second). This study highlights the potential of geometry-driven snapping structures for efficient and programmable actuation in soft robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u91c7\u7528\u87ba\u65cb\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u62cd\u5f26\uff08snapping beam\uff09\u4e0e\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5f80\u590d\u548c\u975e\u5f80\u590d\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u9700\u6c42\u5f3a\u70c8\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u5f39\u6027\u4f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u6750\u6599\u5b58\u5728\u53d8\u5f62\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5931\u7a33\uff08snapping\uff09\u73b0\u8c61\u5bfb\u6c42\u7a81\u7834\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u87ba\u65cb\u7ed3\u6784\u7684metabeam\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u808c\u8171\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528PLA\u6750\u6599\u901a\u8fc7\u7194\u878d\u6c89\u79ef\u5efa\u6a21\uff08FDM\uff093D\u6253\u5370\u6210\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4eff\u751f\u6e38\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u8c03\uff1b\u87ba\u65cb\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u521a\u6027\u6750\u6599\u7684\u5927\u53d8\u5f62\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u5f80\u590d\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bcf0.4\u79d2\u7ea632mm\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684snapping\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u7ed3\u6784\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While measures of such load have played an important role in psycholinguistic theories, they have been formalized, largely, using symbolic grammars, which assign discrete, uniform costs to syntactic predictions. This study proposes a measure of processing storage cost based on an information-theoretic formalization, as the amount of information previous words carry about future context, under uncertainty. Unlike previous discrete, grammar-based metrics, this measure is continuous, theory-neutral, and can be estimated from pre-trained neural language models. The validity of this approach is demonstrated through three analyses in English: our measure (i) recovers well-known processing asymmetries in center embeddings and relative clauses, (ii) correlates with a grammar-based storage cost in a syntactically-annotated corpus, and (iii) predicts reading-time variance in two large-scale naturalistic datasets over and above baseline models with traditional information-based predictors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u52a0\u5de5\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u52a0\u5de5\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u8bed\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u8d4b\u4e88\u79bb\u6563\u4e14\u540c\u8d28\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7acb\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u4e3a\u7ec6\u81f4\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u524d\u6587\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u5883\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u6258\u795e\u7ecf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f9d\u6b21\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e09\u9879\u82f1\u6587\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff1a(1) \u68c0\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5d4c\u5957\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u4ece\u53e5\u7684\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1b(2) \u4e0e\u53e5\u6cd5\u6ce8\u91ca\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b(3) \u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u6599\u9605\u8bfb\u65f6\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u57fa\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u6d4b\u529b\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5d4c\u5957\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u4ece\u53e5\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u52a0\u5de5\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u8bed\u6cd5\u57fa\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff1b3\uff09\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u6599\u9605\u8bfb\u65f6\u957f\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u53e5\u5b50\u52a0\u5de5\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u672c\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u8bed\u8a00\u52a0\u5de5\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This leads to semantic misalignments and physically implausible motions. To address this limitation, we propose TCA-T2M, a framework for temporal consistency-aware T2M generation. Our approach introduces a temporal consistency-aware spatial VQ-VAE (TCaS-VQ-VAE) for cross-sequence temporal alignment, coupled with a masked motion transformer for text-conditioned motion generation.

Motivated by this observation, we propose Thinking by Subtraction, a confidence-driven contrastive decoding approach that improves reasoning reliability through targeted token-level intervention. Our method, Confidence-Driven Contrastive Decoding, detects low-confidence tokens during decoding and intervenes selectively at these positions. It constructs a contrastive reference by replacing high-confidence tokens with minimal placeholders, and refines predictions by subtracting this reference distribution at low-confidence locations. Experiments show that CCD significantly improves accuracy across mathematical reasoning benchmarks while substantially reducing output length, with minimal KV-cache overhead. As a training-free method, CCD enhances reasoning reliability through targeted low-confidence intervention without computational redundancy.

Existing 3D-oriented analysis methods adopt either isolated task-specific modeling or task-agnostic end-to-end paradigms to produce one-hop outputs, impeding the systematic accumulation of perceptual evidence for downstream reasoning. In parallel, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit improved visual perception and can integrate visual and textual information effectively, yet their predominantly 2D-oriented designs fundamentally limit their ability to perceive and analyze volumetric medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose 3DMedAgent, a unified agent that enables 2D MLLMs to perform general 3D CT analysis without 3D-specific fine-tuning. 3DMedAgent coordinates heterogeneous visual and textual tools through a flexible MLLM agent, progressively decomposing complex 3D analysis into tractable subtasks that transition from global to regional views, from 3D volumes to informative 2D slices, and from visual evidence to structured textual representations. Central to this design, 3DMedAgent maintains a long-term structured memory that aggregates intermediate tool outputs and supports query-adaptive, evidence-driven multi-step reasoning. We further introduce the DeepChestVQA benchmark for evaluating unified perception-to-understanding capabilities in 3D thoracic imaging. Experiments across over 40 tasks demonstrate that 3DMedAgent consistently outperforms general, medical, and 3D-specific MLLMs, highlighting a scalable path toward general-purpose 3D clinical assistants.Code and data are available at \\href{https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/3DMedAgent}{https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/3DMedAgent}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e863DMedAgent\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u97003D\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u4e5f\u80fd\u4f7f\u75282D\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c3D CT\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D CT\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u5229\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf93D\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u529b\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "3DMedAgent\u7edf\u4e00\u534f\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MLLM\u4e3b\u4f53\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u76843D CT\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u6574\u4f53\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u3001\u4ece\u4f53\u79ef\u5230\u5207\u7247\u3001\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6c47\u805a\u5de5\u5177\u8f93\u51fa\u652f\u6491\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684DeepChestVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f303D\u80f8\u90e8\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u572840\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c3DMedAgent\u5728\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d85\u8fc7\u901a\u7528\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u73b0\u67093D\u7279\u5b9aMLLMs\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5f3a\u5927\u76843D\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "3DMedAgent\u4e3a3D\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a3D\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u67653D\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u63a8\u52a8\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Timestamped and publicly available on OpenReview: https://openreview.net/forum?id=7MhpFcr5Nx", "summary": "Interactive perception (IP) enables robots to extract hidden information in their workspace and execute manipulation plans by physically interacting with objects and altering the state of the environment -- crucial for resolving occlusions and ambiguity in complex, partially observable scenarios. We present Zero-Shot IP (ZS-IP), a novel framework that couples multi-strategy manipulation (pushing and grasping) with a memory-driven Vision Language Model (VLM) to guide robotic interactions and resolve semantic queries. ZS-IP integrates three key components: (1) an Enhanced Observation (EO) module that augments the VLM's visual perception with both conventional keypoints and our proposed pushlines -- a novel 2D visual augmentation tailored to pushing actions, (2) a memory-guided action module that reinforces semantic reasoning through context lookup, and (3) a robotic controller that executes pushing, pulling, or grasping based on VLM output. Unlike grid-based augmentations optimized for pick-and-place, pushlines capture affordances for contact-rich actions, substantially improving pushing performance. We evaluate ZS-IP on a 7-DOF Franka Panda arm across diverse scenes with varying occlusions and task complexities.

GitHub: https://github.com/aaron0eidt/ELIA", "summary": "While mechanistic interpretability has developed powerful tools to analyze the internal workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), their complexity has created an accessibility gap, limiting their use to specialists. We address this challenge by designing, building, and evaluating ELIA (Explainable Language Interpretability Analysis), an interactive web application that simplifies the outcomes of various language model component analyses for a broader audience. The system integrates three key techniques -- Attribution Analysis, Function Vector Analysis, and Circuit Tracing -- and introduces a novel methodology: using a vision-language model to automatically generate natural language explanations (NLEs) for the complex visualizations produced by these methods. The effectiveness of this approach was empirically validated through a mixed-methods user study, which revealed a clear preference for interactive, explorable interfaces over simpler, static visualizations. A key finding was that the AI-powered explanations helped bridge the knowledge gap for non-experts; a statistical analysis showed no significant correlation between a user's prior LLM experience and their comprehension scores, suggesting that the system reduced barriers to comprehension across experience levels. We conclude that an AI system can indeed simplify complex model analyses, but its true power is unlocked when paired with thoughtful, user-centered design that prioritizes interactivity, specificity, and narrative guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u6b3e\u540d\u4e3aELIA\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7f51\u9875\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7AI\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u7684\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u52a0\u6613\u61c2\u5e76\u9002\u5408\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u7528\u6237\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u95e8\u69db\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u88ab\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u666e\u901a\u7528\u6237\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u52a0\u53cb\u597d\u548c\u6613\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u666e\u53ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3001\u51fd\u6570\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u56de\u8def\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e09\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u5730\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u66f4\u559c\u6b22\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u754c\u9762\uff0cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u6709\u6548\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e86\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7406\u89e3LLM\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5176LLM\u7ecf\u9a8c\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u95e8\u69db\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f18\u826f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0eAI\u89e3\u91ca\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6781\u5927\u7b80\u5316LLM\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u6027\u548c\u666e\u9002\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u6237\u5e2e\u52a9\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

We address this limitation with a two-phase training strategy for fine-grained road marking segmentation that removes full supervision during pretraining and halves the amount of training data during fine-tuning while still outperforming the comparable supervised baseline model. During the self-supervised pretraining, BEVFormer predictions are differentiably reprojected into the image plane and trained against multi-view semantic pseudo-labels generated by the widely used semantic segmentation model Mask2Former. A temporal loss encourages consistency across frames. The subsequent supervised fine-tuning phase requires only 50% of the dataset and significantly less training time. With our method, the fine-tuning benefits from rich priors learned during pretraining boosting the performance and BEV segmentation quality (up to +2.5pp mIoU over the fully supervised baseline) on nuScenes. It simultaneously halves the usage of annotation data and reduces total training time by up to two thirds. The results demonstrate that differentiable reprojection plus camera perspective pseudo labels yields transferable BEV features and a scalable path toward reduced-label autonomous perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684BEV\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684BEV\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u534a\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u751f\u6210BEV\u8bed\u4e49\u56fe\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u5e38\u5e38\u5e26\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7684BEV\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5e0c\u671b\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684Mask2Former\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5c06BEVFormer\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u5730\u6295\u5f71\u56de\u56fe\u50cf\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u635f\u5931\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e27\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b2\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\uff0c\u53ea\u752850%\u5df2\u6709\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u505a\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728nuScenes\u4e0amIoU\u6bd4\u5b8c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u8fbe2.5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ea\u7528\u4e00\u534a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e5f\u7f29\u77ed2/3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u6602\u8d35\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fbBEV\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u51cf\u6807\u6ce8\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

The device translates torsional deformation into measurable capacitance changes, enabling proprioceptive feedback for soft robotic systems. Using dissolvable-core molding, we fabricated a monolithic silicone structure with embedded conductive TPU electrodes, forming an integrated soft capacitor. Mechanical characterization revealed low stiffness and minimal impedance, with torque values below 0.01 N mm for axial displacements between -15 mm and 15 mm, and up to 0.03 N mm at 30 degrees twist under compression. Finite-element simulations confirmed localized stresses along fold lines and validated the measured torque-rotation response. Electrical tests showed consistent capacitance modulation up to 30%, directly correlated with the twist angle, and maximal sensitivity of S_theta ~ 0.0067 pF/deg at 5 mm of axial deformation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Ori-Sense\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u53d7Kresling\u6298\u7eb8\u7ed3\u6784\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u67d4\u6027\u7535\u5bb9\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u6211\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4f53\u7845\u80f6\u6210\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u5bfc\u7535TPU\u7535\u6781\uff0cOri-Sense\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u626d\u8f6c\u53d8\u5f62\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7535\u5bb9\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u76d1\u6d4b\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bf9\u73af\u5883\u548c\u81ea\u8eab\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5173\u8282\u548c\u626d\u8f6c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u548c\u96c6\u6210\u6027\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u6784\u67d4\u987a\u3001\u53ef\u96c6\u6210\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u626d\u8f6c\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d7Kresling\u6298\u7eb8\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u6eb6\u6838\u5fc3\u6210\u578b\u5236\u5907\u5355\u4f53\u7845\u80f6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5e76\u5d4c\u5165\u5bfc\u7535TPU\u7535\u6781\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u67d4\u6027\u7535\u5bb9\u5668\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u529b\u5b66\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u5143\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u68b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u521a\u5ea6\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u626d\u529b\u4f4e\u4e8e0.01 N\u00b7mm\uff08\u8f74\u5411-15~15mm\u8303\u56f4\uff09\uff0c30\u00b0\u626d\u8f6c\u548c\u53d7\u538b\u4e0b\u626d\u529b\u6700\u9ad8\u4e3a0.03 N\u00b7mm\u3002FEA\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6cbf\u6298\u75d5\u96c6\u4e2d\u5e94\u529b\u3002\u7535\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5c55\u73b0\u6700\u5927\u9ad8\u8fbe30%\u7684\u7535\u5bb9\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u6700\u9ad8\u4e3a0.0067 pF/deg\uff08\u8f74\u54115mm\u53d8\u5f62\u65f6\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Ori-Sense\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u67d4\u987a\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u673a\u68b0\u963b\u6297\u548c\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u626d\u8f6c\u611f\u77e5\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5236\u5907\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u4e0e\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

These texts allow researchers to study psychological constructs, detect mental health issues and analyze emotional language. However, mental health data can be difficult to collect correctly from social media, due to suppositions made by the collectors. A more pragmatic strategy involves gathering data through open-ended questions and then assessing this information with self-report screening surveys. This method was employed successfully for English, a language with a lot of psychological NLP resources. However, this cannot be stated for Romanian, which currently has no open-source mental health corpus. To address this gap, we have created the first corpus for depression and anxiety in Romanian, by utilizing a form with 6 open-ended questions along with the standardized PHQ-9 and GAD-7 screening questionnaires. Consisting of the texts of 205 respondents and although it may seem small, PsihoRo is a first step towards understanding and analyzing texts regarding the mental health of the Romanian population.

Yet, existing satellite SM products are too coarse (>1km) for farm-level applications. We present a high-resolution (10m) SM estimation framework for vegetated areas across Europe, combining Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2 optical imagery and ERA-5 reanalysis data through machine learning. Using 113 International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) stations spanning diverse vegetated areas, we compare modality combinations with temporal parameterizations, using spatial cross-validation, to ensure geographic generalization. We also evaluate whether foundation model embeddings from IBM-NASA's Prithvi model improve upon traditional hand-crafted spectral features. Results demonstrate that hybrid temporal matching - Sentinel-2 current-day acquisitions with Sentinel-1 descending orbit - achieves R^2=0.514, with 10-day ERA5 lookback window improving performance to R^2=0.518. Foundation model (Prithvi) embeddings provide negligible improvement over hand-crafted features (R^2=0.515 vs. 0.514), indicating traditional feature engineering remains highly competitive for sparse-data regression tasks.

Standard velocity-based schedules adjust these only approximately and often fail to transfer across tracks and speed profiles. We propose a reinforcement-learning (RL) approach that jointly chooses the lookahead Ld and a steering gain g online using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The policy observes compact state features (speed and curvature taps) and outputs (Ld, g) at each control step. Trained in F1TENTH Gym and deployed in a ROS 2 stack, the policy drives PP directly (with light smoothing) and requires no per-map retuning. Across simulation and real-car tests, the proposed RL-PP controller that jointly selects (Ld, g) consistently outperforms fixed-lookahead PP, velocity-scheduled adaptive PP, and an RL lookahead-only variant, and it also exceeds a kinematic MPC raceline tracker under our evaluated settings in lap time, path-tracking accuracy, and steering smoothness, demonstrating that policy-guided parameter tuning can reliably improve classical geometry-based control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08PPO\uff09\u5728\u7ebf\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316Pure Pursuit\uff08PP\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684lookahead\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u8f6c\u5411\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u5730\u56fe\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8d5b\u8f66\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPure Pursuit\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8d5b\u8f66\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56lookahead\u8ddd\u79bb\u548csteering gain\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u8d5b\u9053\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528PPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u7f51\u7edc\u6bcf\u6b65\u89c2\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u66f2\u7387\u7b49\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8f93\u51falookahead\u548csteering gain\u4e24\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9a71\u52a8PP\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728F1TENTH Gym\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230ROS 2\u5b9e\u9645\u8f66\u8f86\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6bcf\u5f20\u65b0\u5730\u56fe\u91cd\u65b0\u8c03\u53c2\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u8fd8\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u8f66\u8f86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u5408RL-PP\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u5355\u5708\u6210\u7ee9\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u8f6c\u5411\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9alookahead PP\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u901f\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94PP\u548c\u4ec5lookahead RL\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e5f\u8d85\u8fc7\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66MPC\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528RL\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u6539\u5584\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8d5b\u8f66\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Existing resources are limited in scale, focus primarily on isolated characters or short words, and lack controlled lexical content and writer level diversity, which restricts their utility for modern data driven handwriting analysis. As a result, they fail to capture the continuous, fused, and structurally complex nature of Devanagari handwriting, where characters are connected through a shared shirorekha (horizontal headline) and exhibit rich ligature formations. We introduce DohaScript, a large scale, multi writer dataset of handwritten Hindi text collected from 531 unique contributors. The dataset is designed as a parallel stylistic corpus, in which all writers transcribe the same fixed set of six traditional Hindi dohas (couplets). This controlled design enables systematic analysis of writer specific variation independent of linguistic content, and supports tasks such as handwriting recognition, writer identification, style analysis, and generative modeling. The dataset is accompanied by non identifiable demographic metadata, rigorous quality curation based on objective sharpness and resolution criteria, and page level layout difficulty annotations that facilitate stratified benchmarking. Baseline experiments demonstrate clear quality separation and strong generalization to unseen writers, highlighting the dataset's reliability and practical value.

Demystifying VLA Inference Performance with VLA-Perf", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across various embodied AI tasks. While deploying VLA models on real-world robots imposes strict real-time inference constraints, the inference performance landscape of VLA remains poorly understood due to the large combinatorial space of model architectures and inference systems. In this paper, we ask a fundamental research question: How should we design future VLA models and systems to support real-time inference? To address this question, we first introduce VLA-Perf, an analytical performance model that can analyze inference performance for arbitrary combinations of VLA models and inference systems. Using VLA-Perf, we conduct the first systematic study of the VLA inference performance landscape. From a model-design perspective, we examine how inference performance is affected by model scaling, model architectural choices, long-context video inputs, asynchronous inference, and dual-system model pipelines. From the deployment perspective, we analyze where VLA inference should be executed -- on-device, on edge servers, or in the cloud -- and how hardware capability and network performance jointly determine end-to-end latency. By distilling 15 key takeaways from our comprehensive evaluation, we hope this work can provide practical guidance for the design of future VLA models and inference systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VLA-Perf\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cdVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u672a\u6765VLA\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5177\u8eab\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ec4\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5206\u6790\u5f71\u54cdVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u5b9e\u65f6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VLA-Perf\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5bf9\u4efb\u610fVLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u5f02\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7ba1\u9053\u7b49\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u7aef\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u548c\u4e91\u7aef\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0b\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u72b6\u51b5\u5bf9\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7VLA-Perf\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63cf\u7ed8\u4e86VLA\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5168\u666f\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u76f8\u5173\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u51fa15\u9879\u5bf9\u672a\u6765VLA\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5207\u5b9e\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u52a8\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6253\u4e0b\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A critical subset of this backlog comprises appellate cases, which are formal decisions issued by higher courts reviewing the rulings of lower courts. To this end, we present Vichara, a novel framework tailored to the Indian judicial system that predicts and explains appellate judgments. Vichara processes English-language appellate case proceeding documents and decomposes them into decision points. Decision points are discrete legal determinations that encapsulate the legal issue, deciding authority, outcome, reasoning, and temporal context. The structured representation isolates the core determinations and their context, enabling accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. Vichara's explanations follow a structured format inspired by the IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) framework and adapted for Indian legal reasoning. This enhances interpretability, allowing legal professionals to assess the soundness of predictions efficiently. We evaluate Vichara on two datasets, PredEx and the expert-annotated subset of the Indian Legal Documents Corpus (ILDC_expert), using four large language models: GPT-4o mini, Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B. Vichara surpasses existing judgment prediction benchmarks on both datasets, with GPT-4o mini achieving the highest performance (F1: 81.5 on PredEx, 80.3 on ILDC_expert), followed by Llama-3.1-8B.

Existing training-free acceleration methods rely on feature caching and reuse under the assumption of temporal stability. However, reusing features for multiple steps may lead to latent drift and visual degradation. We observe that model outputs evolve smoothly along much of the diffusion trajectory, enabling principled predictions rather than naive reuse. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{PrediT}, a training-free acceleration framework that formulates feature prediction as a linear multistep problem. We employ classical linear multistep methods to forecast future model outputs from historical information, combined with a corrector that activates in high-dynamics regions to prevent error accumulation. A dynamic step modulation mechanism adaptively adjusts the prediction horizon by monitoring the feature change rate. Together, these components enable substantial acceleration while preserving generation fidelity.

These findings demonstrate the potential of asymmetric snapping mechanisms for physically controlled actuation and lay the groundwork for fully untethered and efficient soft robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u504f\u5fc3\u7a79\u9876\u5f62\u7684\u5feb\u5f39\u5f0f\u81f4\u52a8\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u53d8\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6c14\u52a8\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u6c14\u538b\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81f4\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u901a\u5e38\u54cd\u5e94\u8f83\u6162\u3001\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u5feb\u5f39\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5236\u9020\u4e86\u504f\u5fc3\u7a79\u9876\u5f62\u5feb\u5f39\u81f4\u52a8\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5143\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u53d8\u5f62\u4e0e\u6c14\u538b\u7279\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5c06\u56db\u4e2a\u81f4\u52a8\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\u4e8e\u6c14\u52a8\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u6ce2\u6d6a\u5f0f\u534f\u8c03\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u81f4\u52a8\u5668\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6c14\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u6700\u5feb\u901f\u5ea6\u53ef\u8fbe72.78 mm/s\uff087.5 Hz\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5feb\u5f39\u81f4\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a7\u5236\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u7ebf\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We address this challenge through a dual-scale validation framework applied to political stance prediction in argumentative discourse, combining pointwise and pairwise human annotation. Using 22 language models, we construct a large-scale knowledge base of political position predictions for 23,228 arguments drawn from 30 debates that appeared on the UK politicial television programme \\textit{Question Time}. Pointwise evaluation shows moderate human-model agreement (Krippendorff's $\u03b1=0.578$), reflecting intrinsic subjectivity, while pairwise validation reveals substantially stronger alignment between human- and model-derived rankings ($\u03b1=0.86$ for the best model). This work contributes: (i) a practical validation methodology for subjective continuous knowledge that balances scalability with reliability; (ii) a validated structured argumentation knowledge base enabling graph-based reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation in political domains; and (iii) evidence that ordinal structure can be extracted from pointwise language models predictions from inherently subjective real-world discourse, advancing knowledge representation capabilities for domains where traditional symbolic or categorical approaches are insufficient.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u89c2\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u70b9\u8bc4\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e24\u79cd\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u653f\u6cbb\u7acb\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8865\u5145\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u5982\u653f\u6cbb\u7acb\u573a\uff09\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u5e76\u5bcc\u6709\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08pairwise validation\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u517c\u5177\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u70b9\u8bc4\u6807\u6ce8\uff08pointwise annotation\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6807\u6ce8\uff08pairwise annotation\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u653f\u6cbb\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4f7f\u752822\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u82f1\u56fd\u653f\u8bba\u8282\u76ee\u201cQuestion Time\u201d\u4e2d\u768430\u573a\u8fa9\u8bba\u300123228\u6761\u8bba\u70b9\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u653f\u6cbb\u7acb\u573a\u9884\u6d4b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u53cc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7acb\u573a\u70b9\u8bc4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\uff0cKrippendorff's \u03b1\u4e3a0.578\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e00\u5b9a\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.86\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u5224\u65ad\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u76f8\u5f53\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\uff081\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u89c2\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u653f\u6cbb\u7acb\u573a\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u6709\u76ca\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u751f\u6210\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e3b\u89c2\u73b0\u5b9e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u5f81\u3002"}}

However, in real-world scenarios, it is often impractical to expect that all data processed by an AI system satisfy this assumption. Furthermore, failure to appropriately handle out-of-distribution (OOD) objects may introduce safety risks in real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving or medical assistance). Unfortunately, current research has not yet provided valid benchmarks that can comprehensively assess the performance of VLMs in response to OOD data. Therefore, we propose OODBench, a predominantly automated method with minimal human verification, for constructing new benchmarks and evaluating the ability of VLMs to process OOD data. OODBench contains 40K instance-level OOD instance-category pairs, and we show that current VLMs still exhibit notable performance degradation on OODBench, even when the underlying image categories are common. In addition, we propose a reliable automated assessment metric that employs a Basic-to-Advanced Progression of prompted questions to assess the impact of OOD data on questions of varying difficulty more fully.

Each component targets a different source of inefficiency: i) pruning removes redundant neurons in MLP layers, ii) SVD reduces attention projections into compact low-rank factors, iii) and 8-bit quantization uniformly compresses all linear layers. At matched compression ratios, SPQ outperforms individual methods (SVD-only, pruning-only, or quantization-only) in perplexity, demonstrating the benefit of combining complementary techniques. Applied to LLaMA-2-7B, SPQ achieves up to 75% memory reduction while maintaining or improving perplexity (e.g., WikiText-2 5.47 to 4.91) and preserving accuracy on downstream benchmarks such as C4, TruthfulQA, and GSM8K. Compared to strong baselines like GPTQ and SparseGPT, SPQ offers competitive perplexity and accuracy while using less memory (6.86 GB vs. 7.16 GB for GPTQ). Moreover, SPQ improves inference throughput over GPTQ, achieving up to a 1.9x speedup, which further enhances its practicality for real-world deployment. The effectiveness of SPQ's robust compression through layer-aware and complementary compression techniques may provide practical deployment of LLMs in memory-constrained environments.

In this work, we investigate the performance of ViTs in elementary visual judgment tasks inspired by the foundational studies of Cleveland and McGill, which quantified the accuracy of human perception across different visual encodings. Inspired by their study, we benchmark ViTs against CNNs and human participants in a series of controlled graphical perception tasks. Our results reveal that, although ViTs demonstrate strong performance in general vision tasks, their alignment with human-like graphical perception in the visualization domain is limited.

Recent methods achieve dense reconstructions from da Vinci robotic surgery videos, with Gaussian Splatting (GS) offering real-time performance via graphics acceleration. However, reconstruction quality in occluded regions remains limited, and depth accuracy has not been fully assessed, as benchmarks like EndoNeRF and StereoMIS lack 3D ground truth. We propose Diff2DGS, a novel two-stage framework for reliable 3D reconstruction of occluded surgical scenes. In the first stage, a diffusion-based video module with temporal priors inpaints tissue occluded by instruments with high spatial-temporal consistency. In the second stage, we adapt 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with a Learnable Deformation Model (LDM) to capture dynamic tissue deformation and anatomical geometry. We also extend evaluation beyond prior image-quality metrics by performing quantitative depth accuracy analysis on the SCARED dataset. Diff2DGS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both appearance and geometry, reaching 38.02 dB PSNR on EndoNeRF and 34.40 dB on StereoMIS. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that optimizing for image quality alone does not necessarily translate into optimal 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this, we further optimize the depth quality of the reconstructed 3D results, ensuring more faithful geometry in addition to high-fidelity appearance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDiff2DGS\u7684\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u5b9e\u65f6\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u8d28\u91cf\u548c3D\u6df1\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bc6\u96c6\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e3D\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6Diff2DGS\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bf9\u88ab\u624b\u672f\u5668\u68b0\u906e\u6321\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4fee\u590d\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e8c\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5f62\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7ec4\u7ec7\u52a8\u6001\u5f62\u53d8\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728SCARED\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u6df1\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "Diff2DGS\u5728EndoNeRF\u548cStereoMIS\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523038.02 dB\u548c34.40 dB\u7684PSNR\uff0c\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u73b0\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u80fd\u786e\u4fdd\u6700\u4f73\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "Diff2DGS\u517c\u987e\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u906e\u6321\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We introduce retrieve-verify-retrieve (RVR), a multi-round retrieval framework designed to maximize answer coverage. Initially, a retriever takes the original query and returns a candidate document set, followed by a verifier that identifies a high-quality subset. For subsequent rounds, the query is augmented with previously verified documents to uncover answers that are not yet covered in previous rounds. RVR is effective even with off-the-shelf retrievers, and fine-tuning retrievers for our inference procedure brings further gains.

However, real-world navigation is inherently conditioned by the agent's mobility constraints. For example, a sweeping robot cannot traverse stairs, while a quadruped can. We introduce Capability-Conditioned Navigation (CapNav), a benchmark designed to evaluate how well VLMs can navigate complex indoor spaces given an agent's specific physical and operational capabilities. CapNav defines five representative human and robot agents, each described with physical dimensions, mobility capabilities, and environmental interaction abilities. CapNav provides 45 real-world indoor scenes, 473 navigation tasks, and 2365 QA pairs to test if VLMs can traverse indoor environments based on agent capabilities. We evaluate 13 modern VLMs and find that current VLM's navigation performance drops sharply as mobility constraints tighten, and that even state-of-the-art models struggle with obstacle types that require reasoning on spatial dimensions. We conclude by discussing the implications for capability-aware navigation and the opportunities for advancing embodied spatial reasoning in future VLMs. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/makeabilitylab/CapNav", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6CapNav\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u8003\u5bdf\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u5177\u5907\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba/\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0bVLM\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u53d7\u5236\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u4f53\u7684\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e0\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u8fbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e5f\u5404\u5f02\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u7814\u7a76\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u80fd\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faCapNav\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba/\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u8be6\u7ec6\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u7269\u7406\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u5305\u542b45\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u3001473\u4e2a\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c2365\u4e2aQA\u5bf9\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5VLM\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fdb\u884c\u5408\u7406\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "result": "\u5bf913\u79cd\u6700\u65b0VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u52a0\u4e25\uff0c\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8003\u8651\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u624d\u80fd\u907f\u969c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f9d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76ee\u524dVLM\u5728\u9762\u4e34\u5f3a\u7269\u7406/\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u529b\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u4ecd\u6709\u8f83\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5efa\u8bae\u4eca\u540eVLM\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u66f4\u91cd\u89c6\u80fd\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

However, their performance deteriorates in tasks requiring rich socio-cultural knowledge and diverse local contexts, particularly those involving Indian Culture. Existing Cultural benchmarks are (i) Manually crafted, (ii) contain single-hop questions testing factual recall, and (iii) prohibitively costly to scale, leaving this deficiency largely unmeasured. To address this, we introduce VIRAASAT, a novel, semi-automated multi-hop approach for generating cultural specific multi-hop Question-Answering dataset for Indian culture. VIRAASAT leverages a Knowledge Graph comprising more than 700 expert-curated cultural artifacts, covering 13 key attributes of Indian culture (history, festivals, etc). VIRAASAT spans all 28 states and 8 Union Territories, yielding more than 3,200 multi-hop questions that necessitate chained cultural reasoning. We evaluate current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) LLMs on VIRAASAT and identify key limitations in reasoning wherein fine-tuning on Chain-of-Thought(CoT) traces fails to ground and synthesize low-probability facts. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework named Symbolic Chain-of-Manipulation (SCoM). Adapting the Chain-of-Manipulation paradigm, we train the model to simulate atomic Knowledge Graph manipulations internally. SCoM teaches the model to reliably traverse the topological structure of the graph. Experiments on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) demonstrate that SCoM outperforms standard CoT baselines by up to 20%.

In this paper, we introduce the Distortion-aware Motion Calibrator (DMC), a post-hoc module that refines physically implausible motions (e.g., foot floating) while preserving semantic consistency with the original textual description. Rather than relying on complex physical modeling, we propose a self-supervised and data-driven approach, whereby DMC learns to obtain physically plausible motions when an intentionally distorted motion and the original textual descriptions are given as inputs. We evaluate DMC as a post-hoc module to improve motions obtained from various text-to-motion generation models and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving physical plausibility while enhancing semantic consistency. The experimental results show that DMC reduces FID score by 42.74% on T2M and 13.20% on T2M-GPT, while also achieving the highest R-Precision. When applied to high-quality models like MoMask, DMC improves the physical plausibility of motions by reducing penetration by 33.0% as well as adjusting floating artifacts closer to the ground-truth reference.

However, unlike CLIP encoders, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has not been explored. Ours being the first work studying this topic, we first formulate attacks that aim to perturb the features extracted by discrete tokenizers, and thus change the extracted tokens. These attacks are computationally efficient, application-agnostic, and effective across classification, multimodal retrieval, and captioning tasks. Second, to defend against this vulnerability, inspired by recent work on robust CLIP encoders, we fine-tune popular tokenizers with unsupervised adversarial training, keeping all other components frozen. While unsupervised and task-agnostic, our approach significantly improves robustness to both unsupervised and end-to-end supervised attacks and generalizes well to unseen tasks and data. Unlike supervised adversarial training, our approach can leverage unlabeled images, making it more versatile. Overall, our work highlights the critical role of tokenizer robustness in downstream tasks and presents an important step in the development of safe multimodal foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff08tokenizer\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u9632\u5fa1\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff1b\u800c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5176\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u6cdb\u7528\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b2\uff09\u501f\u9274\u9c81\u68d2CLIP\u8bad\u7ec3\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6297\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u51bb\u7ed3\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\u5177\u5907\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b49\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5df2\u6709\u53ca\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6587\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches still face challenges in fine-grained semantic understanding, particularly when dealing with complex textual descriptions. To overcome these limitations, we propose DEIG, a novel framework for fine-grained and controllable multi-instance generation. DEIG integrates an Instance Detail Extractor (IDE) that transforms text encoder embeddings into compact, instance-aware representations, and a Detail Fusion Module (DFM) that applies instance-based masked attention to prevent attribute leakage across instances. These components enable DEIG to generate visually coherent multi-instance scenes that precisely match rich, localized textual descriptions. To support fine-grained supervision, we construct a high-quality dataset with detailed, compositional instance captions generated by VLMs. We also introduce DEIG-Bench, a new benchmark with region-level annotations and multi-attribute prompts for both humans and objects. Experiments demonstrate that DEIG consistently outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks in spatial consistency, semantic accuracy, and compositional generalization. Moreover, DEIG functions as a plug-and-play module, making it easily integrable into standard diffusion-based pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "DEIG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e0a\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u63a7\u5236\u4ecd\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDEIG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ec6\u8282\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff08IDE\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u4e3a\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u7ec6\u8282\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08DFM\uff09\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u6cc4\u9732\u3002\u8fd8\u65b0\u5efa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u533a\u57df\u7ea7\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDEIG\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u7ec4\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7075\u6d3b\u96c6\u6210\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7ba1\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "DEIG\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u5bf9\u9f50\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Effectively combining textual and visual modalities requires adherence to the sketch visual structure when leveraging the guidance of localized attributes from text. We present LOcalized Text and Sketch with multi-level guidance (LOTS), a framework that enhances fashion image generation by combining global sketch guidance with multiple localized sketch-text pairs. LOTS employs a Multi-level Conditioning Stage to independently encode local features within a shared latent space while maintaining global structural coordination. Then, the Diffusion Pair Guidance stage integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we develop Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Sketchy provides high-quality, clean sketches with a professional look and consistent structure. To assess robustness beyond this setting, we also include an \"in the wild\" split with non-expert sketches, featuring higher variability and imperfections. Experiments demonstrate that our method strengthens global structural adherence while leveraging richer localized semantic guidance, achieving improvement over state-of-the-art.

These issues are exacerbated in multi-view capture, where differences in lighting, sensor responses, and image signal processor (ISP) configurations introduce photometric and chromatic inconsistencies that violate the assumptions of photometric consistency underlying modern 3D novel view synthesis (NVS) methods, including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), leading to degraded reconstruction and rendering quality. We propose Luminance-GS++, a 3DGS-based framework for robust NVS under diverse illumination conditions. Our method combines a globally view-adaptive lightness adjustment with a local pixel-wise residual refinement for precise color correction. We further design unsupervised objectives that jointly enforce lightness correction and multi-view geometric and photometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across challenging scenarios, including low-light, overexposure, and complex luminance and chromatic variations.

In this paper, leveraging the ability of the Laplacian of Gaussian operator to enhance the boundaries of medical images, we define the G-LoG (Gaussian-Laplacian of Gaussian) bi-filtration to generate the features more suitable for multi-parameter persistence module. By modeling volumetric images as bounded functions, then we prove the interleaving distance on the persistence modules obtained from our bi-filtrations on the bounded functions is stable with respect to the maximum norm of the bounded functions.

In safety-critical settings, it is therefore insufficient to produce predictions without assessing whether the input remains within the detector's nominal operating regime. We refer to this capability as self-aware object detection.\n  We introduce a degradation-aware self-awareness framework based on degradation manifolds, which explicitly structure a detector's feature space according to image degradation rather than semantic content. Our method augments a standard detection backbone with a lightweight embedding head trained via multi-layer contrastive learning. Images sharing the same degradation composition are pulled together, while differing degradation configurations are pushed apart, yielding a geometrically organized representation that captures degradation type and severity without requiring degradation labels or explicit density modeling.\n  To anchor the learned geometry, we estimate a pristine prototype from clean training embeddings, defining a nominal operating point in representation space. Self-awareness emerges as geometric deviation from this reference, providing an intrinsic, image-level signal of degradation-induced shift that is independent of detection confidence.\n  Extensive experiments on synthetic corruption benchmarks, cross-dataset zero-shot transfer, and natural weather-induced distribution shifts demonstrate strong pristine-degraded separability, consistent behavior across multiple detector architectures, and robust generalization under semantic shift. These results suggest that degradation-aware representation geometry provides a practical and detector-agnostic foundation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u8eab\u8f93\u5165\u662f\u5426\u53d7\u964d\u8d28\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u611f\u77e5\u5404\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u964d\u8d28\uff0c\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u505a\u51fa\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6e05\u6670\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u538b\u7f29\u6216\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u7b49\u56fe\u50cf\u964d\u8d28\u65f6\u4f1a\u6084\u65e0\u58f0\u606f\u5730\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f93\u5165\u662f\u5426\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u81ea\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u523b\u4e0d\u5bb9\u7f13\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u964d\u8d28\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u81ea\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u540e\u589e\u8bbe\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u5934\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u8be5\u5d4c\u5165\u5c06\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u964d\u8d28\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u62c9\u8fd1\uff0c\u5c06\u964d\u8d28\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u8fdc\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u5e72\u51c0\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5747\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u70b9\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u504f\u79bb\u8861\u91cf\u964d\u8d28\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u964d\u8d28\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5e72\u6270\u57fa\u51c6\u3001\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u5929\u6c14\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5e72\u51c0-\u964d\u8d28\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u964d\u8d28\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u4e0e\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u81ea\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

For this purpose, we evaluate existing diffusion transformer conditioning strategies and propose an effective mechanism for 3D head and hand control, enabling dexterous hand--object interactions. We train a bidirectional video diffusion model teacher using this strategy and distill it into a causal, interactive system that generates egocentric virtual environments. We evaluate this generated reality system with human subjects and demonstrate improved task performance as well as a significantly higher level of perceived amount of control over the performed actions compared with relevant baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9XR\u73af\u5883\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u4e92\u52a8\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684XR\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u63a5\u53d7\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\u6216\u952e\u76d8\u8f93\u5165\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u7528\u6237\u5728\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u8eab\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7ec6\u8282\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5934\u90e8\u53ca\u624b\u90e8\u5173\u8282\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u51653D\u5934\u624b\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6559\u5e08\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u81f3\u56e0\u679c\u578b\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u89d2\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u901a\u8fc7\u771f\u4eba\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4f46\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5934\u90e8\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8XR\u73af\u5883\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u6c89\u6d78\u7684\u865a\u62df\u4f53\u9a8c\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Current methods lack this spatial awareness. We close this gap with the first real-time, fully causal method for spatially-aware conversational motion, deployable on a streaming VR headset. Given a user's position and dyadic audio, our approach produces full-body motion that aligns gestures with speech while orienting the agent according to the user. Our architecture combines a causal transformer-based VAE with interleaved latent tokens for streaming inference and a flow matching model conditioned on user trajectory and audio. To support varying gaze preferences, we introduce a gaze scoring mechanism with classifier-free guidance to decouple learning from control: the model captures natural spatial alignment from data, while users can adjust eye contact intensity at inference time. On the Embody 3D dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art motion quality at over 300 FPS -- 3x faster than non-causal baselines -- while capturing the subtle spatial dynamics of natural conversation. We validate our approach on a live VR system, bringing spatially-aware conversational agents to real-time deployment.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on key-value caching to accumulate frame-level information over time, but use a limited number of tokens per frame, leading to the loss of fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose scaling the token budget to enable more granular spatiotemporal understanding and reasoning. First, we find that current methods are ill-equipped to handle dense streams: their feature encoding causes query-frame similarity scores to increase over time, biasing retrieval toward later frames. To address this, we introduce an adaptive selection strategy that reduces token redundancy while preserving local spatiotemporal information. We further propose a training-free retrieval mixture-of-experts that leverages external models to better identify relevant frames.
