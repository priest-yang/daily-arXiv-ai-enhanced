To enable systematic and fine-grained evaluation, we developed RxBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers common prescription review categories and consolidates 14 frequent types of prescription errors drawn from authoritative pharmacy references. RxBench consists of 1,150 single-choice, 230 multiple-choice, and 879 short-answer items, all reviewed by experienced clinical pharmacists. We benchmarked 18 state-of-the-art LLMs and identified clear stratification of performance across tasks. Notably, Gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06, Grok-4-0709, and DeepSeek-R1-0528 consistently formed the first tier, outperforming other models in both accuracy and robustness. Comparisons with licensed pharmacists indicated that leading LLMs can match or exceed human performance in certain tasks. Furthermore, building on insights from our benchmark evaluation, we performed targeted fine-tuning on a mid-tier model, resulting in a specialized model that rivals leading general-purpose LLMs in performance on short-answer question tasks. The main contribution of RxBench lies in establishing a standardized, error-type-oriented framework that not only reveals the capabilities and limitations of frontier LLMs in prescription review but also provides a foundational resource for building more reliable and specialized clinical tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6RxBench\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u90e8\u5206LLMs\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0a\u5df2\u5ab2\u7f8e\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u836f\u5e08\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f85\u52a9\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u81f4\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86RxBench\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4ece\u6743\u5a01\u836f\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u603b\u7ed3\u4e8614\u7c7b\u5e38\u89c1\u5904\u65b9\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86RxBench\uff0c\u5305\u62ec1150\u9053\u5355\u9009\u9898\u3001230\u9053\u591a\u9009\u9898\u548c879\u9053\u7b80\u7b54\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u6709\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u836f\u5e08\u5ba1\u6838\u3002\u968f\u540e\u5bf918\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41LLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u5c42\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u7b49\u6c34\u5e73\u7684LLM\u505a\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cGemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06\u3001Grok-4-0709\u548cDeepSeek-R1-0528\u4e09\u6b3e\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u7b2c\u4e00\u68af\u961f\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u836f\u5e08\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7ecf\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b80\u7b54\u9898\u4e0a\u5df2\u63a5\u8fd1\u9876\u5c16\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "RxBench\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u524d\u6cbfLLM\u5728\u5904\u65b9\u5ba1\u6838\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u63ed\u793a\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u5177\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Typically, state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models are developed by large corporations based on large data collections and substantial computational and financial resources required to pretrain such models from scratch. These foundation models then serve as the basis for further development and domain adaptation for specific use cases or tasks. However, given the dynamic and fast-paced nature of launching new foundation models, the process of selecting the most suitable model for a particular use case, application, or domain becomes increasingly complex. We argue that there are two main dimensions that need to be taken into consideration when selecting a model for further training: a qualitative dimension (which model is best suited for a task based on information, for instance, taken from model cards) and a quantitative dimension (which is the best performing model). The quantitative performance of models is assessed through leaderboards, which rank models based on standardized benchmarks and provide a consistent framework for comparing different LLMs. In this work, we address the analysis of the quantitative dimension by exploring the current leaderboards and benchmarks. To illustrate this analysis, we focus on the medical domain as a case study, demonstrating the evolution, current landscape, and practical significance of this quantitative evaluation dimension.

However, existing inference methods typically rely on local, immediate-step metrics such as confidence or entropy which inherently lack a more reliable perspective. This limitation frequently leads to inconsistent sampling trajectories and suboptimal generation quality. To address this, we propose Coherent Contextual Decoding (CCD), a novel inference framework built upon two core innovations. First, CCD employs a trajectory rectification mechanism that leverages historical context to enhance sequence coherence, enabling the early rejection of suboptimal paths. We demonstrate that this mechanism is theoretically equivalent to modeling the consistency of historical steps via the conditional mutual information between context and token predictions. Building on this theoretical insight, we further address the inefficiency of conventional uniform decoding budgets. Instead of rigid allocations based on diffusion steps, we introduce an adaptive sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the unmasking budget for each step according to our consistency metric. Consequently, our method significantly improves the quality of generation trajectories while accelerating the sampling process. Empirically, our method achieves a simultaneous enhancement in both inference speed and performance across diverse benchmarks on Dream and LLaDA, delivering up to 3.48x speedup alongside 3.91% performance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u300c\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89e3\u7801\uff08CCD\uff09\u300d\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u53cc\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684DLMs\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u5373\u65f6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u71b5\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u6b20\u4f73\u3002\u4e9f\u9700\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u5177\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u6821\u6b63\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u8861\u91cf\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u4ee5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u5386\u53f2\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u30022\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "CCD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Dream\u548cLLaDA\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad83.48\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8fbe3.91%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CCD\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u5386\u53f2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86DLMs\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.\n  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.\n  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping.

Thus, oftentimes, LLMs are fine-tuned to address a specific task, given the pretrained weights of a pre-trained LLM considered a foundation model. In this work, we introduce memory-efficient, reversible architectures for LLMs, inspired by symmetric and symplectic differential equations, and investigate their theoretical properties. Different from standard, baseline architectures that store all intermediate activations, the proposed models use time-reversible dynamics to retrieve hidden states during backpropagation, relieving the need to store activations.

One way to achieve this is by coordinating swarms of autonomous aerial vehicles carrying communications equipment to form an ad-hoc network connecting emergency response personnel to both each other and central command. However, operating in such extreme environments may lead to individual networking agents being damaged or rendered inoperable, which could bring down the network and interrupt communications.\n  To overcome this challenge and enable multi-agent UAV networking in difficult environments, this paper introduces and formalizes the problem of Robust Task Networking Under Attrition (RTNUA), which extends connectivity maintenance in multi-robot systems to explicitly address proactive redundancy and attrition recovery. We introduce Physics-Informed Robust Employment of Multi-Agent Networks ($\u03a6$IREMAN), a topological algorithm leveraging physics-inspired potential fields to solve this problem. Through simulation across 25 problem configurations, $\u03a6$IREMAN consistently outperforms the DCCRS baseline, and on large-scale problems with up to 100 tasks and 500 drones, maintains $>99.9\\%$ task uptime despite substantial attrition, demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u707e\u5bb3\u7b49\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u4fe1\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u706b\u707e\u7b49\u7d27\u6025\u6551\u63f4\u73b0\u573a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u65bd\u5f80\u5f80\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u642d\u5efa\u7684\u4e34\u65f6\u7f51\u7edc\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002\u4f46\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bb9\u6613\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u65ad\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u673a\u5236\u6765\u4fdd\u969c\u7f51\u7edc\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u53d7\u635f\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u4efb\u52a1\u7f51\u7edc\u201d\uff08RTNUA\uff09\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86$\u03a6$IREMAN\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u501f\u9274\u7269\u7406\u573a\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u6062\u590d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ec4\u7f51\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709DCCRS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u572825\u7ec4\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c$\u03a6$IREMAN\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eDCCRS\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\uff08100\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c500\u67b6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5927\u91cf\u635f\u8017\uff0c\u4efb\u52a1\u8fd0\u884c\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8fbe99.9%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "$\u03a6$IREMAN\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5355\u70b9\u5931\u6548\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u65ad\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u707e\u5bb3\u5e94\u6025\u901a\u4fe1\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. Code available at: https://github.com/hdeng26/Contex", "summary": "Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e8616\u79cd\u6700\u65b0\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u4fe1\u606f\u626d\u66f2\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u5982\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u88c1\u526a\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u65f6\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u626d\u66f2\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u7b7e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u539f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u914d\u5bf9\u91cd\u89c6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u5584\u8be5\u4fe1\u606f\u626d\u66f2\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6536\u655b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u7740\u91cd\u533a\u5206\u540c\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5f02\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\u5219\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u6765\u81ea\u540c\u4e00\u5f20\u56fe\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6837\u672c\u62c9\u8fd1\uff0c\u62c9\u8fdc\u5176\u5b83\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7efc\u5408\u517c\u987e\u7c7b\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u539f\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u505a\u4e86\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CIFAR10\u3001CIFAR100\u3001Caltech-101\u3001Caltech-256\u3001ImageNet\u3001BiasedMNIST\u3001UTKFace\u548cCelebA\u516b\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e8616\u79cd\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u8fd8\u662f\u5b66\u4e60\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728BiasedMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u626d\u66f2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe22.9%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4fe1\u606f\u626d\u66f2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

DI can help to improve the downstream speech related tasks even when speakers have a strong dialect. However, fine-tuning a speech model for tasks like DI is expensive in terms of computation cost and memory requirement. Recent studies have explored fine-tuning pre-trained speech models for tasks like DI using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, which offer parameter efficiency but limited improvement in memory efficiency and training speed. To address these challenges, we explore Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning (MEFT) methods, originally proposed for language processing, and apply them to the general-purpose pre-trained speech model. We then comprehensively analyze the GPU memory usage and fine-tuning speed based on various MEFT methods. As a case study, we fine-tune the Whisper model to identify six Mandarin subdialects from the KeSpeech dataset, reducing GPU memory usage by up to 73.25% and accelerating training speed by a factor of 2.1, while maintaining accuracy comparable to vanilla fine-tuning and PEFT methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MEFT\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u97f3\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4eGPU\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u52a0\u5feb\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u5982\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08MEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u901a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cMEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790\u3002\u4ee5Whisper\u6a21\u578b\u5728KeSpeech\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff086\u79cd\u666e\u901a\u8bdd\u65b9\u8a00\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528MEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u540e\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a\u8fbe73.25%\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.1\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u65b9\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4e0e\u539f\u751f\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6301\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "MEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u97f3\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5f00\u5c55\u65b9\u8a00\u7b49\u8bed\u97f3\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5171\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\uff08T2I\uff09\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709T2I\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4ee4\u4eba\u5370\u8c61\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u56fe\u7247\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u7ed9\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u989c\u8272\u3001\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\uff09\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u9519\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684VLMs\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u5c1a\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u573a\u666f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u9075\u5faa\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30T2I\u6a21\u578b\u548cVLMs\u3002\u5728\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\uff0c\u75285\u4e2aT2I\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u7247\uff0c\u5e76\u75313\u4e2aVLMs\u5bf927\u7c7b\u5177\u4f53\u5931\u8d25\u7c7b\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u6ce8\u518d\u7531Llama3\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba1\u6838\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u53ca\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u9ad8\u96be\u5ea6\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u7247\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u6ce8\u89e3\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5448\u73b0\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec6\u8282\u6027\u5931\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u5728\u53cd\u6620T2I\u53caVLMs\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9519\u8bef\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this work, we present a data efficient strategy for fine tuning BERT on hate speech classification by significantly reducing training set size without compromising performance. Our approach employs a TF IDF-based sample selection mechanism to retain only the most informative 75 percent of examples, thereby minimizing training overhead. To address the limitations of BERT's native vocabulary in capturing evolving hate speech terminology, we augment the tokenizer with domain-specific slang and lexical variants commonly found in abusive contexts. Experimental results on a widely used hate speech dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while improving computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for scalable and adaptive abusive content moderation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03BERT\u7528\u4e8e\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u9009\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u56e0\u65b0\u5174\u4fda\u8bed\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e0d\u65ad\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65b0\u8bcd\u6c47\u63a7\u5236\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u3002", "method": "1. \u7528TF-IDF\u65b9\u6cd5\u9009\u53d6\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u768475%\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u30022. \u6269\u5c55BERT\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u9886\u57df\u76f8\u5173\u4fda\u8bed\u548c\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u8f83\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u539f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\uff0c\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5VDD\uff08Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u81ea\u8f66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u5c06\u81ea\u8f66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u5bf9\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u4e24\u8005\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "VDD\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u81ea\u8f66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5355\u72ec\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u6570\u5404\u5f02\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8c03\u6574\uff08PAD\uff09\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\uff08PAT\uff09\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVDD\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VDD\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5f15\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type.

To reduce computing and memory cost, pruning offers a promising solution by removing unimportant parameters. However, despite their success on standard LLMs, existing pruning methods severely damage RLMs, as even moderate sparsity (e.g., 20%) can collapse accuracy and completely disrupt the model's reasoning coherence. We begin by analyzing why existing pruning pipelines fail on reasoning LLMs and find that their brittleness largely stems from a mismatch between the calibration data, the pruning objective, and the model's decode-time reasoning behavior. Our study further shows that the most reliable calibration signal comes not from human-written labels but from the model's own self-generated reasoning traces, which more accurately reflect its inference distribution. Guided by these insights, we introduce RESP, a self-reflective structured pruning framework that aligns pruning decisions with the model's reasoning dynamics through self-generated calibration, decode-only gradient-based importance estimation, and progressive regeneration that maintains calibration fidelity as sparsity increases. Experiments on Qwen3-8B demonstrate that RESP markedly outperforms existing structured pruning methods on both GSM8K and MathQA, preserving near-dense accuracy at 20-30% sparsity and substantially mitigating performance collapse at higher sparsity levels. At 40% sparsity, RESP attains 81.3% accuracy on GSM8K and 59.6% on MathQA, surpassing the strongest baselines by 66.87% and 47%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRESP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11Reasoning LLM\uff08RLMs\uff09\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLM\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u79ef\u5e9e\u5927\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5197\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002\u526a\u679d\u867d\u80fd\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3RLMs\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RLMs\u4e0a\u7684\u5931\u6548\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u548c\u526a\u679d\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u6821\u51c6\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u4f30\u7b97\u53c2\u6570\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u518d\u751f\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Qwen3-8B\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cRESP\u5728\u4fdd\u630120%-30%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\uff08\u598240%\uff09\u65f6GSM8K\u548cMathQA\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523081.3%\u548c59.6%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RESP\u53ef\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4eRLMs\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u526a\u679d\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as \"intent\" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents.

A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results.

The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86MODOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u9a8c\u73af\u5883\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u4eba\u548c\u513f\u7ae5\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u663e\u793a\u6027\u5730\u8868\u793a\u6240\u5f97\u8bed\u6cd5\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u4e60\u5f97\u5e76\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u53ef\u63a7\u53c8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u6210\u4eba\u4e0e\u513f\u7ae5\u4e24\u4e2a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u513f\u7ae5\u4ee3\u7406\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u6210\u4eba\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u4e60\u5f97\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u65b0\u53e5\u5b50\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4e60\u5f97\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u513f\u7ae5\u4ee3\u7406\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u4eba\u4ee3\u7406\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6210\u529f\u4e60\u5f97\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u8bed\u6cd5\u8303\u7574\uff0c\u4e60\u5f97\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "MODOMA\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5c55\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u4e60\u5f97\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u4ee3\u7406\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u8bed\u6cd5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4e60\u5f97\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u5176\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, this design process is typically led by monodisciplinary approaches, often overlooking interdisciplinary knowledge and the experiential knowledge of workers who will ultimately share tasks with these systems. To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects. The framework emerges as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and a boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, guiding designers, empowering workers, and contributing to more just and collaborative futures of work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5927\u591a\u7531\u5355\u4e00\u5b66\u79d1\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u53ca\u5de5\u4eba\u5b9e\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65e5\u76ca\u878d\u5165\u5de5\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u652f\u6491\u591a\u65b9\u6709\u6548\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee5\u9ad8\u5c42\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5e94\u7528\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e13\u5bb6\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u5546\u54c1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d3b\u52a8\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u5c55\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u4e3a\u4e2d\u4ecb\u6027\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ea7\u7269\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u7269\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5de5\u4eba\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u516c\u6b63\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u8d4b\u80fd\u5de5\u4eba\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5171\u540c\u521b\u9020\u3002"}}

Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K.

Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6SAM2Grasp\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u65f6\u5e8f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5355\u4e00\u6293\u53d6\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5728\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u5373\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u591a\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u793a\u8303\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5c06\u5404\u4e2a\u6293\u53d6\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e73\u5747\u5316\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u65e0\u6548\u3001\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6293\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSAM2Grasp\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982\u7531\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u5305\u56f4\u6846\uff09\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684SAM2\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f93\u51fahead\u3002SAM2\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u65f6\u5e8f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6307\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5728\u6700\u521d\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u540e\u5373\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u83b7\u5f97\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u518d\u663e\u5f0f\u5916\u90e8\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSAM2Grasp\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u65b0\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM2Grasp\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6293\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u53ca\u65f6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u7684\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u517c\u5177\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u9769\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.\n  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).\n  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u5148\u9a8c\uff08\u5355\u5206\u5f62\u548c\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u518d\u6821\u51c6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86U-Net\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u5728\u8bf8\u591a\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u73b0\u8c61\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u6c60\u5316\u6216\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5355\u5206\u5f62\u548c\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u518d\u6821\u51c6\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5728U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u901a\u9053\u8d4b\u4e88\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5f62\u6307\u6570\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u8c31\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08ISIC18\u3001Kvasir-SEG\u3001BUSI\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u518d\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u9ad8\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728U-Net\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7531\u4e8e\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6df1\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e76\u4e0d\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u4e13\u4e00\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5206\u5f62\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aU-Net\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5f62\u7279\u6027\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6709\u76ca\u63a2\u7d22\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose LiteReason, a latent reasoning method that can be interleaved with standard token sampling and easily combined with RL techniques. LiteReason employs a lightweight Reasoning Projector module, trained to produce continuous latent tokens that help the model 'skip' reasoning steps. During RL, the policy model decides when to activate the projector, switching between latent and discrete reasoning as needed. Experimental results on plot hole detection and book chapter generation show that our method outperforms latent reasoning baselines and comes close to matching non-latent RL training, while reducing final reasoning length by 77-92%. Overall, LiteReason guides RL training to a more efficient part of the performance-computation tradeoff curve.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5LiteReason\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6bb5\u6587\u672c\u6216\u53d9\u4e8b\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLiteReason\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Reasoning Projector\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728token\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u201c\u8df3\u6b65\u201d\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8df3\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4e0eRL\u7ed3\u5408\u3002RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u63a8\u7406\u95f4\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u60c5\u8282\u6f0f\u6d1e\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u7ae0\u8282\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cLiteReason\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed77-92%\uff0c\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u51e0\u4e4e\u63a5\u8fd1\u975e\u6f5c\u5728RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "LiteReason\u5728\u4e0d\u5927\u5e45\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u7b97\u529b\u6548\u7387\u7684\u66f4\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments.

These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic\" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats.

Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions. To address these limitations, CogDrive introduces a cognition driven multimodal prediction and planning framework that integrates explicit modal reasoning with safety aware trajectory optimization. The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios. By combining cognitive multimodal prediction with safety oriented planning, CogDrive offers an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic.", "AI": {"tldr": "CogDrive\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u5230\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6216\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u5f0a\u7aef\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u53c8\u6ce8\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9002\u914d\u6027\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "CogDrive\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u52a0\u6743\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u90e8\u5206\u7ed3\u5408\u62d3\u6251\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8fd1\u90bb\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7f55\u89c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u89c4\u5212\u90e8\u5206\u5c06\u7d27\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u77ed\u671f\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u5206\u652f\u5219\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u907f\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u5728Argoverse2\u548cINTERACTION\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCogDrive\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6f0f\u68c0\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u95ed\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u5982\u5e76\u7ebf\u3001\u8def\u53e3\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CogDrive\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8ba4\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5177\u6709\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception.

These strategies can be found in unstructured data (for example, scientific literature from the Elsevier website) or structured (heterogeneous climate data via government APIs). We present Climate Adaptation question-answering with Improved Readability and Noted Sources (CAIRNS), a framework that enables experts -- farmer advisors -- to obtain credible preliminary answers from complex evidence sources from the web. It enhances readability and citation reliability through a structured ScholarGuide prompt and achieves robust evaluation via a consistency-weighted hybrid evaluator that leverages inter-model agreement with experts. Together, these components enable readable, verifiable, and domain-grounded question-answering without fine-tuning or reinforcement learning.

Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\\% of their energy consumption.

This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6LTAA\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aLTAA\u5728\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u5907\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5efa\u7b51\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765LLM\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5374\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5206\u914d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaLTAA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u9636\u6bb5\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5206\u914d\u3001\u591a\u7ea7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u7ea0\u6b63\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u5efa\u7b51\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u3001Q-learning\u4e0eDQN\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "LTAA\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0token\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u7f29\u51cf94.6%\u3001\u5206\u914d\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed86%\u3002\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u4e13\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cLTAA\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u738777%\uff0c\u4e14\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u914d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e2d\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u53ca\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u8c03\u6574\u5206\u914d\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u72ec\u7279\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5efa\u7b51\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

A Closer Look at LLMs as Solution Verifiers", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can act as both problem solvers and solution verifiers, with verifiers improving solver performance by selecting high-quality answers from a pool of candidates. However, prior studies of solver-verifier interactions have been limited, focusing mainly on self-verification and rarely examining how verifiers judge outputs from models in their own or in another model family. Modern LLMs also undergo extensive post-training, but its effect on verification remains unclear. We present a systematic study across 37 models spanning multiple families, sizes, and base vs. post-trained variants, evaluated on 9 benchmarks covering logical reasoning, structured puzzles, symbolic computation, mathematics, commonsense, factual recall, and domain knowledge. We compare self-verification with verification within the same family and across different families. To support this, we introduce and empirically validate verifier gain, a metric that predicts the performance improvements from test-time verifier-based rejection sampling. We analyze how metrics like verifier gain and false positive rate scale with model size and post-training, and characterize differences in dataset verifiability. Our findings show that cross-family verification is especially effective; post-training reduces self-improvement but strengthens cross-family improvement; and mathematical and logical tasks exhibit the highest inherent verifiability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u9898\u8005\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u589e\u76ca\u6307\u6807\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08post-training\uff09\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u6df1\u5165\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9009\u53d6\u4e86\u6a2a\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u72b6\u6001\u768437\u4e2aLLM\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e5d\u7c7b\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u96be\u9898\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u8fd0\u7b97\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u5e38\u8bc6\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u56de\u5fc6\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u505a\u4e86\u89e3\u9898\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u540c\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ca\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u589e\u76ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u91c7\u6837\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u9898\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6570\u5b66\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u5929\u7136\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u589e\u76ca\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u53cd\u6620\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u68c0\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u5bb6\u65cf\u7b54\u6848\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u53ca\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u540e\u7eedLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5177\u6709\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Yang Zhang leads the whole project", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \\textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TACO\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u7247\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u4f2a\u8ba1\u6570\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "VLA\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u5305\u542b\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6b21\u4f18\u751a\u81f3\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u793a\u8303\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u65e0\u5173\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u771f\u5b9e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TACO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f2a\u8ba1\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u4f5c\u7247\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u4f2a\u8ba1\u6570\u6700\u5927\uff08\u5373\u6700\u53ef\u80fd\u5c5e\u4e8e\u6210\u529f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u3002\u7ea6\u675f\u4ec5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u751f\u6548\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d41\u6216\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u505aRL\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u51c6\uff08RoboTwin2.0\u3001Robotwin\u3001LIBERO\u3001SimplerEnv\uff09\u548c\u53cc\u81c2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u52a0\u5165TACO\u540e\uff0cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "TACO\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u826f\u597d\u63a8\u5e7f\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u66b4\u9732\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u6781\u4e3a\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u5173\u952e\u6027\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5c42\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7531VLM\u6307\u5bfc\u573a\u666f\u76ee\u6807\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u6218\u7565\u5c42\u3001\u5236\u8ba2\u5f15\u5bfc\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6218\u672f\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u771f\u5b9e\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u80cc\u666f\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5229\u7528VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4e0eVLM\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u53ca\u6f0f\u6d1e\u66b4\u9732\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, current systems often fail to accurately translate user intent into satisfactory story outputs due to a lack of fine-grained control and unclear input specifications, limiting their applicability. To address this, we propose TaleFrame, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) with human-computer interaction (HCI) to generate stories through structured information, enabling precise control over the generation process. The innovation of TaleFrame lies in decomposing the story structure into four basic units: entities, events, relationships, and story outline. We leverage the Tinystories dataset, parsing and constructing a preference dataset consisting of 9,851 JSON-formatted entries, which is then used to fine-tune a local Llama model. By employing this JSON2Story approach, structured data is transformed into coherent stories. TaleFrame also offers an intuitive interface that supports users in creating and editing entities and events and generates stories through the structured framework. Users can control these units through simple interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop, attach, and connect), thus influencing the details and progression of the story. The generated stories can be evaluated across seven dimensions (e.g., creativity, structural integrity), with the system providing suggestions for refinement based on these evaluations. Users can iteratively adjust the story until a satisfactory result is achieved. Finally, we conduct quantitative evaluation and user studies that demonstrate the usefulness of TaleFrame.

To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100\\% navigation success and 0.09 s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples.

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u7136\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5916\u89c2\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4ee5\u5f80\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u5728\u533a\u5206\u5916\u89c2\u6781\u4e3a\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f3a\u5065\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u6027\u548c\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u521d\u671f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u6216\u9488\u5bf9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f5c\u8005\u81ea\u5236\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u5916\u89c2\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u4e866\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u53ca\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u53d8\u4e0b\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u7269\u4f53\u6709\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u62d3\u5c55\u4e86\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ece\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u533a\u5206\u5916\u89c2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost.

However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Using the EVONS and FakeNewsNet datasets, we compare textual embeddings (RoBERTa; with a control using Mistral) against lightweight numeric features (timing, follower counts, verification, likes) and sequence models (GRU, gating architectures, Transformer encoders). We show that textual content alone is a strong discriminator for fake-news detection, while numeric-only pipelines remain viable when language models are unavailable or compute is constrained. Virality prediction is markedly harder than fake-news detection and is highly sensitive to label construction; in our setup, a median-based ''viral'' split (<50 likes) is pragmatic but underestimates real-world virality, and time-censoring for engagement features is desirable yet difficult under current API limits. Dimensionality-reduction analyses suggest non-linear structure is more informative for virality than for fake-news detection (t-SNE > PCA on numeric features). Swapping RoBERTa for Mistral embeddings yields only modest deltas, leaving conclusions unchanged. We discuss implications for evaluation design and report reproducibility constraints that realistically affect the field.

While task-space planning and control have been extensively studied for larger, arm-scale manipulators, demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in compact, multi-DoF robotic fingers remain scarce. In this paper, we present the physical prototyping and experimental characterization of a three-degree-of-freedom, linkage-driven, series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and a closed-form Jacobian. A resolved motion rate control (RMRC) scheme is implemented to achieve closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking. We experimentally evaluate the fingertip tracking performance across a variety of trajectories, including straight lines, circles, and more complex curves, and report millimeter-level accuracy.

However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated.

Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Video2Act\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08VDM\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVideo2Act\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408VDM\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u524d\u666f\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6ee4\u9664\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563Transformer\uff08DiT\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u5934\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5f02\u6b65\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06VDM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6162\u901f\u7684System 2\uff0cDiT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u7684System 1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "Video2Act\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6bd4\u5148\u524dVLA\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad87.7%\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u9ad821.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\uff0cVideo2Act\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \\& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u6781\u5177\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6nuScenes\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u540c\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u56e0\u5176\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u521b\u65b0\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u56de\u987e\u4e86nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u521b\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ca\u5176\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6269\u5c55\uff08nuImages\u4e0ePanoptic nuScenes\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5efa\u56fe\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86nuScenes\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5b98\u65b9\u548c\u975e\u5b98\u65b9\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7efc\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f17\u591a\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u6280\u672f\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5176\u5f15\u9886\u7684\u884c\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8enuScenes\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5b66\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "nuScenes\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5bf9\u793e\u533a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

To address this issue, we propose **CAPO** (**C**urriculum **A**dvantage **P**olicy **O**ptimization), an adaptive curriculum mechanism based on advantage signals. The proposed mechanism bootstraps imitation learning with positive-only advantage samples to establish robust foundations, and subsequently introduces negative signals to cultivate discriminative capabilities, thereby improving generalization across complex scenarios.

Experiments with different datasets, including integration into an operational place recognition policy, validate the practical relevance of these findings and demonstrate that carefully designed projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e0d\u540cLiDAR\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u68c0\u7d22\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee33D\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLiDAR\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a3D\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u9ad8\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u7814\u7a76\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u65b0\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6216\u66ff\u4ee3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef3D\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u53ea\u6539\u53d8\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u901a\u9053\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3001\u73af\u5883\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9645\u653f\u7b56\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u670d\u52a1\u4e8eLiDAR\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684LiDAR\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4f5c\u4e3a3D\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVACoT\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u5e94\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u51e0\u4e4e\u672a\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u6216\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u56de\u62a5\u9012\u51cf\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3VLMs\u6613\u53d7\u6270\u52a8\u5f71\u54cd\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u9ad8\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u6210\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVACoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684agent\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5197\u957f\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u53ea\u505a\u5c40\u90e8\u526a\u88c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cVACoT\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u666e\u9002\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u62d3\u5bbd\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cVACoT\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728OCR\u76f8\u5173\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdvOCR\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u540e\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "VACoT\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLMs\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u3002"}}

However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion.

TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08ResNet-50\u4e0eSqueezeNet\uff09\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u7247\u81ea\u52a8\u8bca\u65ad\u7ed3\u6838\u75c5\uff08TB\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0cSqueezeNet\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u6838\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f4e\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\u96be\u4ee5\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u4fbf\u6377\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Kaggle\u4e0a\u76844200\u5f20\u80f8\u7247\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3ResNet-50\u4e0eSqueezeNet\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u67e5\u51c6\u7387\u3001\u67e5\u5168\u7387\u7b49\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "SqueezeNet\u6a21\u578b\u635f\u5931\u738732%\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u738789%\u3001\u67e5\u51c6\u738798%\u3001\u67e5\u5168\u738780%\u3001F1\u5206\u657087%\uff1bResNet-50\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684TB\u68c0\u6d4b\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u5e7f\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

One-way ANOVA reveals a significant primacy effect for BERTScore across all stances, indicating that summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article. Pairwise comparisons further show that Position 1 differs significantly from Positions 2 and 3, while the latter two do not differ from each other, confirming a selective preference for the first document.

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a \"hard-to-easy\" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faU4D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e8f\u5217\u76844D\u73af\u5883\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u5f0f4D\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u51fa\u73b0\u5931\u771f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "U4D\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u4e24\u6b65\u5904\u7406\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0b\u8865\u5168\u5269\u4f59\u533a\u57df\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u7a7a\u6df7\u5408\uff08MoST\uff09\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "U4D\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e8f\u5217\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "U4D\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e864D\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To address this issue, recent work has explored ``editing'' LLM parameters to mitigate social bias with model merging approaches; however, there is no empirical comparison. In this work, we empirically survey seven algorithms: Linear, Karcher Mean, SLERP, NuSLERP, TIES, DELLA, and Nearswap, applying 13 open weight models in the GPT, LLaMA, and Qwen families. We perform a comprehensive evaluation using three bias datasets (BBQ, BOLD, and HONEST) and measure the impact of these techniques on LLM performance in downstream tasks of the SuperGLUE benchmark. We find a trade-off between bias reduction and downstream performance: methods achieving greater bias mitigation degrade accuracy, particularly on tasks requiring reading comprehension and commonsense and causal reasoning. Among the merging algorithms, Linear, SLERP, and Nearswap consistently reduce bias while maintaining overall performance, with SLERP at moderate interpolation weights emerging as the most balanced choice.

While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion.

However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}tyle-\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{GE}neralization framework (\\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSAGE\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u901a\u7528\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5e38\u89c4\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u66f4\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "SAGE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u6e90\u57df\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u7ec4\u53ef\u8986\u76d6\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u6027\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8c03\u6574\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u683c\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAGE\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5177\u5907\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE\u4e3a\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u51bb\u7ed3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u65e0\u6743\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce CREST (CRoss-lingual Efficient Safety Transfer), a parameter-efficient multilingual safety classification model that supports 100 languages with only 0.5B parameters. By training on a strategically chosen subset of only 13 high-resource languages, our model utilizes cluster-based cross-lingual transfer from a few to 100 languages, enabling effective generalization to both unseen high-resource and low-resource languages. This approach addresses the challenge of limited training data in low-resource settings. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across six safety benchmarks to demonstrate that CREST outperforms existing state-of-the-art guardrails of comparable scale and achieves competitive results against models with significantly larger parameter counts (2.5B parameters and above).

However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

Decades of psychophysics research show that humans intuitively process and integrate noisy signals using near-optimal Bayesian strategies in perceptual tasks. We ask whether LLMs exhibit similar behaviour and perform optimal multimodal integration without explicit training or instruction. Adopting the psychophysics paradigm, we infer computational principles of LLMs from systematic behavioural studies. We introduce a behavioural benchmark - BayesBench: four magnitude estimation tasks (length, location, distance, and duration) over text and image, inspired by classic psychophysics, and evaluate a diverse set of nine LLMs alongside human judgments for calibration. Through controlled ablations of noise, context, and instruction prompts, we measure performance, behaviour and efficiency in multimodal cue-combination. Beyond accuracy and efficiency metrics, we introduce a Bayesian Consistency Score that detects Bayes-consistent behavioural shifts even when accuracy saturates. Our results show that while capable models often adapt in Bayes-consistent ways, accuracy does not guarantee robustness. Notably, GPT-5 Mini achieves perfect text accuracy but fails to integrate visual cues efficiently. This reveals a critical dissociation between capability and strategy, suggesting accuracy-centric benchmarks may over-index on performance while missing brittle uncertainty handling. These findings reveal emergent principled handling of uncertainty and highlight the correlation between accuracy and Bayesian tendencies.

Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

We extend the evaluation across 7 subjects and augment the LLM-as-a-Judge framework with human references to strengthen evaluation-human alignment.

The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels.

Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks.

Such errors undermine trust and hinder their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, two distinct research paradigms have emerged: model-centric Hallucination Detection (HD) and text-centric Fact Verification (FV). Despite sharing the same goal, these paradigms have evolved in isolation, using distinct assumptions, datasets, and evaluation protocols. This separation has created a research schism that hinders their collective progress. In this work, we take a decisive step toward bridging this divide. We introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that enables direct, instance-level comparison between FV and HD by dynamically generating model outputs and corresponding factuality labels. Through large-scale experiments across multiple LLM families and detection methods, we reveal three key findings: (1) No paradigm is universally superior; (2) HD and FV capture complementary facets of factual errors; and (3) hybrid approaches that integrate both methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. Beyond benchmarking, we provide the first in-depth analysis of why FV and HD diverged, as well as empirical evidence supporting the need for their unification. The comprehensive experimental results call for a new, integrated research agenda toward unifying Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification in LLMs.\n  We have open-sourced all the code, data, and baseline implementation at: https://github.com/oneal2000/UniFact/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UniFact\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b(HD)\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1(FV)\u4e24\u5927\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e8c\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1HD\u548cFV\u90fd\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u76f8\u4e92\u72ec\u7acb\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5f7c\u6b64\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7814\u7a76\u5272\u88c2\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u9886\u57df\u6574\u4f53\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u6253\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9694\u9602\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e8c\u8005\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3aLLM\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUniFact\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0HD\u4e0eFV\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5404\u8303\u5f0f\u53ca\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8fd8\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e8c\u8005\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u6b67\u7684\u6839\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1\uff09HD\u4e0eFV\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u80dc\uff1b2\uff09\u4e24\u8005\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408HD\u4e0eFV\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u72ec\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u5b9e\u8bc1HD\u548cFV\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5f02\u540c\u53ca\u6574\u5408\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u9886\u57df\u8fc8\u5411\u7edf\u4e00\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLM\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u6240\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u533a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty.

This study proposes TriLex, a three-stage retrieval augmented framework that unifies corpus-based extraction, cross lingual mapping, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) driven lexical refinement to systematically expand sentiment lexicons for low-resource languages. Using the enriched lexicon, the performance of two prominent African pretrained language models (AfroXLMR and AfriBERTa) is evaluated across multiple case studies. Results demonstrate that AfroXLMR delivers superior performance, achieving F1-scores above 80% for isiXhosa and isiZulu and exhibiting strong cross-lingual stability. Although AfriBERTa lacks pre-training on these target languages, it still achieves reliable F1-scores around 64%, validating its utility in computationally constrained settings.

However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models.

In this work, we propose stable rank, an intrinsic, annotation-free quality signal derived from model representations. Stable rank measures the effective dimensionality of hidden states by computing the ratio of total variance to dominant-direction variance, capturing quality through how information distributes across representation dimensions. Empirically, stable rank achieves 84.04% accuracy on RewardBench and improves task accuracy by an average of 11.3 percentage points over greedy decoding via Best-of-N sampling. Leveraging this insight, we introduce Stable Rank Group Relative Policy Optimization (SR-GRPO), which uses stable rank as a reward signal for reinforcement learning. Without external supervision, SR-GRPO improves Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct by 10% on STEM and 19% on mathematical reasoning, outperforming both learned reward models and self-evaluation baselines.

Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration.

However, such evaluations are challenged by the individualized, holistic, and diverse nature of TCM's \"Syndrome Differentiation and Treatment\" (SDT). Existing benchmarks are confined to knowledge-based question-answering or the accuracy of syndrome differentiation, often neglecting assessment of treatment decision-making. Here, we propose a comprehensive, clinical case-based benchmark spearheaded by TCM experts, and a specialized reward model employed to quantify prescription-syndrome congruence. Data annotation follows a rigorous pipeline. This benchmark, designated TCM-BEST4SDT, encompasses four tasks, including TCM Basic Knowledge, Medical Ethics, LLM Content Safety, and SDT. The evaluation framework integrates three mechanisms, namely selected-response evaluation, judge model evaluation, and reward model evaluation. The effectiveness of TCM-BEST4SDT was corroborated through experiments on 15 mainstream LLMs, spanning both general and TCM domains. To foster the development of intelligent TCM research, TCM-BEST4SDT is now publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTCM-BEST4SDT\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u4e2d\u533b\uff08TCM\uff09\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u201c\u8fa8\u8bc1\u65bd\u6cbb\u201d\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5ffd\u89c6\u5904\u65b9\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u533b\u9886\u57df\u9010\u6e10\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u4e2d\u533b\u8fa8\u8bc1\u65bd\u6cbb\u5177\u6709\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u3001\u6574\u4f53\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u95ee\u7b54\u6216\u57fa\u7840\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u5c1a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b8c\u6574\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5904\u65b9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff09\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u7531\u4e2d\u533b\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e34\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6TCM-BEST4SDT\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u56db\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u57fa\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u533b\u5fb7\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u8fa8\u8bc1\u65bd\u6cbb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u5904\u65b9\u4e0e\u8fa8\u8bc1\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u5305\u62ec\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u3001\u81ea\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e25\u8c28\u3002", "result": "\u572815\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u901a\u7528\u53ca\u4e2d\u533b\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86TCM-BEST4SDT\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u591a\u7ef4\u8bc4\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TCM-BEST4SDT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e2d\u533b\u8fa8\u8bc1\u65bd\u6cbb\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u533b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GUI Exploration Lab\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3a\u56fe\u5f62\u754c\u9762\u5bfc\u822a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9GUI\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u5f62\u754c\u9762\uff08GUI\uff09\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u53d7\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u754c\u9762\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u6d4b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5236\u7ea6\u4e86\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86GUI Exploration Lab\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7075\u6d3b\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u754c\u9762\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5355\u8f6e\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5355\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u52a8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u7b56\u7565\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u754c\u9762\u5bfc\u822a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "GUI Exploration Lab\u4e3aGUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u5177\u666e\u9002\u6027\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Lecture materials are inherently multimodal, combining spoken audio with visual slides, which requires systems capable of processing multiple input modalities. To provide an accessible and complete learning experience, translations must preserve all modalities: text for reading, slides for visual understanding, and speech for auditory learning. We present \\textbf{BOOM}, a multimodal multilingual lecture companion that jointly translates lecture audio and slides to produce synchronized outputs across three modalities: translated text, localized slides with preserved visual elements, and synthesized speech. This end-to-end approach enables students to access lectures in their native language while aiming to preserve the original content in its entirety. Our experiments demonstrate that slide-aware transcripts also yield cascading benefits for downstream tasks such as summarization and question answering.

However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "WorldMM\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u6216\u66f4\u4e45\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u80fd\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u957f\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "WorldMM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u7c7b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f53\uff1a\u60c5\u8282\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u65f6\u957f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7d22\u5f15\uff1b\u8bed\u4e49\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u9ad8\u9636\u6982\u5ff5\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u7559\u573a\u666f\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u591a\u6b21\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u65f6\u957f\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u83b7\u53d6\u5145\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cWorldMM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u660e\u663e\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53478.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "WorldMM\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u58c1\u5792\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u957f\u3001\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLightHCG\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7AI\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u56e0\u679c\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79efVAE\u7684LightHCG\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408HSIC\u8fdb\u884c\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9752\u5149\u773c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "LightHCG\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7528\u8f83\u5c11\uff08\u51cf\u5c1193-99%\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4InceptionV3\u3001MobileNetV2\u548cVGG16\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u667a\u80fd\u8f85\u52a9\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eedAI\u8f85\u52a9\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e72\u9884\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While prior work has focused on English-only settings, real-world deployments benefit from having a single prompt to operate reliably across languages. This paper presents a comprehensive study of how different system prompts steer models toward accurate and robust cross-lingual behavior. We propose a unified four-dimensional evaluation framework to assess system prompts in multilingual environments. Through large-scale experiments on five languages, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we uncover that certain prompt components, such as CoT, emotion, and scenario, correlate with robust multilingual behavior. We develop a prompt optimization framework for multilingual settings and show it can automatically discover prompts that improve all metrics by 5-10%. Finally, we analyze over 10 million reasoning units and find that more performant system prompts induce more structured and consistent reasoning patterns, while reducing unnecessary language-switching. Together, we highlight system prompt optimization as a scalable path to accurate and robust multilingual LLM behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u53ef\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4e3b\u8981\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u82f1\u8bed\uff0c\u7136\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5173\u6ce8\u5982\u4f55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u4e09\u79cdLLM\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u8fd8\u5bf9\u4e00\u5343\u4e07\u6761\u63a8\u7406\u5355\u5143\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u542b\u6709\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\uff08CoT\uff09\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u573a\u666f\u7b49\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u8bed\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5728\u5404\u9879\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e865-10%\u3002\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e5f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5207\u6362\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u63d0\u5347LLM\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time.

Bangla is spoken by more than 230 million people of Bangladesh and India (West Bengal). Despite the grow- ing need for automated moderation on social media platforms, Bangla is significantly under- represented in computational resources. In this work, we study Subtask 1A and Subtask 1B of the BLP 2025 Shared Task on hate speech detection. We reproduce the official base- lines (e.g., Majority, Random, Support Vec- tor Machine) and also produce and consider Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and De- cision Tree as baseline methods. We also uti- lized transformer-based models such as Dis- tilBERT, BanglaBERT, m-BERT, and XLM- RoBERTa for hate speech classification. All the transformer-based models outperformed base- line methods for the subtasks, except for Distil- BERT.

Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBOLT\uff08Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u914d\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u4e8e\u5168\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684meta-learning\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5b66\u5230\u826f\u597d\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5df2\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u8fd8\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "BOLT\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u5408\u5e76\u5df2\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u63d0\u53d6\u4f53\u7cfb\u6b63\u4ea4\u3001\u53d7\u5f53\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8c31\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8be5\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u6536\u96c6\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u4e3b\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u5c42\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u4f53\u7cfb\u57fa\u5e95\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u51bb\u7ed3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u5e95\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9\u89d2\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ee5\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u8fd8\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u7cfb\u6570\u6c60\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBOLT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684meta-learned\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u9650\u5236\u5728\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\uff0cBOLT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u6570\u636e/\u8ba1\u7b97\u8981\u6c42\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aTemporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE)\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNNs\uff09\u5bf9\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dSNNs\u8f93\u5165\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fc7\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86SNNs\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faTDE\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2aSpiking Encoder\uff08SE\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u523a\u6fc0\uff1b\u4e00\u4e2aAttention Gating Module\uff08AGM\uff09\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5f15\u5bfcSE\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11AGM\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u989d\u5916\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Spike-Driven Attention\uff08SDA\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "TDE\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709SNN\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e2d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PASCAL VOC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8657.7%\u7684mAP50-95\uff0c\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001EvDET200K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8647.6%\u3002SDA\u80fd\u8017\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5e38\u89c4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u76840.240\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "TDE\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SNNs\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We present SchED, a training-free, model-agnostic early-exit algorithm that aggregates full-span logit margins and halts decoding once a smooth, progress-dependent confidence threshold is met. We evaluated SchED on two dLLM families (Dream and LLaDA), in base and instruction-tuned variants across ten benchmarks spanning downstream tasks including multiple-choice question answering (MCQ), math, long-form QA/summarization, and translation. SchED delivers large, stable accelerations: on instruction-tuned models, it achieves $3.8$-$4.0\\times$ speedups while retaining $99.8$-$100\\%$ of the baseline score on average. On base models, SchED yields consistent speedup gains with $99.1$-$100\\%$ performance retention, with up to $2.34\\times$ under more aggressive settings. Using a conservative speed metric that heavily penalizes quality loss (QPS, $\u03b3{=}4$), we show that SchED is robust and clearly outperforms prior confidence-based early-exit methods, which break down on long-form generation. An entropy analysis of the model's token predictions reveals that instruction tuning speeds up the decay of predictive entropy.

We attribute this hardware-model mismatch to two primary factors: the quantization brittleness of Vision Transformers (ViTs) and the I/O-bound nature of autoregressive attention mechanisms, which fail to utilize the high arithmetic throughput of NPUs. To bridge this gap, we propose AutoNeural, an NPU-native VLM architecture co-designed for integer-only inference. We replace the standard ViT encoder with a MobileNetV5-style backbone utilizing depthwise separable convolutions, which ensures bounded activation distributions for stable INT4/8/16 quantization. Complementing this, our language backbone integrates State-Space Model (SSM) principles with Transformer layers, employing efficient gated convolutions to achieve linear-time complexity. This hybrid design eliminates the heavy memory I/O overhead of Key-Value caching during generation. Our approach delivers substantial efficiency gains, reducing quantization error of vision encoder by up to 7x and end-to-end latency by 14x compared to conventional baselines. The AutoNeural also delivers 3x decoding speed and 4x longer context window than the baseline. We validate these improvements via a real-world automotive case study on the Qualcomm SA8295P SoC, demonstrating real-time performance for cockpit applications.

As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

This work introduces a novel framework that inputs English sentences, converts them into logical expressions, and then translates them into Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) for satisfiability solving. It employs classical NLP techniques with self-defined grammar, symbolic computation libraries, and a fine-tuned language model to reduce hallucinations. In the early experiments, we observed that the fine-tuned model, trained on different grammar settings, could intentionally correct the same types of hallucinations made by the original model.

However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features.

Existing alignment frameworks, structured approaches designed to align model behavior with human ethical and social norms, often rely on static datasets and post-hoc evaluations, offering limited insight into how ethical reasoning may evolve across different contexts or temporal scales. This study presents the Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP), a dataset-free, closed-loop framework for continuously evaluating and interpreting the moral stability of LLMs. MoCoP combines three supporting layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis, (ii) semantic risk estimation, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling within a self-sustaining architecture that autonomously generates, evaluates, and refines ethical scenarios without external supervision. Our empirical results on GPT-4-Turbo and DeepSeek suggest that MoCoP effectively captures longitudinal ethical behavior, revealing a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity dimensions (correlation rET = -0.81, p value less than 0.001) and a near-zero association with response latency (correlation rEL approximately equal to 0). These findings demonstrate that moral coherence and linguistic safety tend to emerge as stable and interpretable characteristics of model behavior rather than short-term fluctuations. Furthermore, by reframing ethical evaluation as a dynamic, model-agnostic form of moral introspection, MoCoP offers a reproducible foundation for scalable, continuous auditing and advances the study of computational morality in autonomous AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6MoCoP\uff0c\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f26\u7406\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4f26\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u5883\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u6001\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u8bcd\u6c47\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u5efa\u6a21\u4e09\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4f26\u7406\u60c5\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-4-Turbo\u548cDeepSeek\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cMoCoP\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u957f\u65f6\u4f26\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u6bd2\u6027\u5448\u5f3a\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u4f26\u7406\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "MoCoP\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f26\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4f26\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f26\u7406\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002"}}

However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6See-Think-Learn\uff08STL\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u601d\u8def\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u6216\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86See-Think-Learn\uff08STL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u89c2\u5bdf\uff08\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u518d\u601d\u8003\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b3\uff09\u52a0\u5165\u53cd\u4f8b\u63a8\u7406\uff08negative rationale\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fa8\u6790\u9519\u8bef\u9009\u9879\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5224\u522b\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSTL\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b54\u6848\u6216\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "STL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u3001\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u5ec9\u7684\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLMs\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u6602\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u4e13\u6709\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics.

However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SEER-Bench\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0e3DSPMR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u987a\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u590d\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2dAI\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u987a\u5e8f\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u90e8\u5206\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\uff08\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u590d\u7528\u5148\u524d\u63a2\u7d22\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faSEER-Bench\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u62ec\u2018\u4f53\u95ee\u7b54(EQA)\u2019\u548c\u2018\u591a\u6a21\u5bfc\u822a(EMN)\u2019\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u987a\u5e8f\u5316\u7684\u4f53\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa3DSPMR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u6b21\u663e\u5f0f\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5165MLLM\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "3DSPMR\u5728\u987a\u5e8fEQA\u548cEMN\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u590d\u7528\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0MLLM\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u663e\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u987a\u5e8f\u4f53\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency.

Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies.

Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a3D-SLIM\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53473D\u573a\u666f-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u66f4\uff0c\u5374\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u5e76\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u65e0\u5e8f\u76843D\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e3D\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa3D-SLIM\uff083D Spatial Language Instruction Mask\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1\uff09\u6839\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a9\u7801\uff0c2\uff09\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u6ce8\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u611f\u77e5\u63a9\u7801\u3002\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c3D\u573a\u666f-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c3D-SLIM\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57283D\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "3D-SLIM\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e3D\u5bf9\u8c61\u65e0\u5e8f\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u5e26\u6765\u91cd\u5927\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u9614\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results.

We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region.

We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation.

We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain.

However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios.

This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.\n  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.\n  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.\n  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.\n  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684CoDeGraph\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u5176\u63a8\u5e7f\u52303D\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u3002", "motivation": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u5de5\u4e1a\u548c\u533b\u7597\u573a\u666f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9047\u5230\u91cd\u590d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f02\u5e38\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u56e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u6216\u8ddd\u79bb\u504f\u79bb\u5bfc\u81f4\u5931\u6548\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u7406\u8bba\u63ed\u793a\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790ViT\u7279\u5f81\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u201c\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4f38\u7f29\u201d\u548c\u201c\u90bb\u57df\u65e0\u6548\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684CoDeGraph\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u533a\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u6548\u4f53\u7d20\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0MRI\u4e09\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7531CoDeGraph\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "CoDeGraph\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6291\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f02\u5e38\u5f71\u54cd\u30023D\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u5272\u3002\u5176\u4f2a\u63a9\u7801\u8fd8\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763CLIP\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e863D\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u5272\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning.

Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982VGGT\u548c\u03c0^3\uff09\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u52a0\u901f8-10\u500d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u6a21\u578b\u5982VGGT\u548c\u03c0^3\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u591f\u7406\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e86VGGT\u548c\u03c0^3\u4e2d\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5404\u5c42\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5206\u5de5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u5b9e\u9645\u672a\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u4e2d\u671f\u8d77\u5230\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f5c\u7528\u3001\u672b\u671f\u4e3b\u8981\u4f5c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5916\u4e24\u6b65\u52a0\u901f\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5c06\u65e9\u671f\u5168\u5c40\u5c42\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u5e27\u5185\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7684K/V\u8fdb\u884c\u659c\u5bf9\u89d2\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5747\u503c\u586b\u5145\u7684\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8eVGGT\u548c\u03c0^3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u751a\u81f3\u5c0f\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b08-10\u500d\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u81f4\u5206\u6790\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OmniPerson\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149/\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u518d\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ReID\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4eba\u518d\u8bc6\u522b\uff08ReID\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u532e\u4e4f\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u81ea\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86ReID\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4eba\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OmniPerson\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u80fd\u9488\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u548c\u7ea2\u5916ReID\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u7247/\u89c6\u9891\u30021\uff09\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u884c\u4eba\u5404\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u7ec6\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u591a\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u4efb\u610f\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5305\u62ecRGB-IR\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u529f\u80fd\u30022\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1Multi-Refer Fuser\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u201c\u84b8\u998f\u201d\u7edf\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u30023\uff09\u63a8\u51faPersonSyn\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u53ea\u542bID\u6807\u7b7e\u7684ReID\u57fa\u51c6\u96c6\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u884c\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "OmniPerson\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u884c\u4eba\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6c34\u5e73\uff08SoTA\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0cReID\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniPerson\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86ReID\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f1a\u5f00\u6e90\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Panel2Patch\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u6790\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u9762\u677f\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u8bca\u7597\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faPanel2Patch\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ece\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u6316\u6398\u591a\u9762\u677f\u3001\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u56fe\u548c\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u89e3\u6790\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u9762\u677f\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6309\u56fe\u3001\u9762\u677f\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\uff08patch\uff09\u7b49\u5c42\u7ea7\u8fdb\u884c\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u54ea\u6015\u4ec5\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6587\u732e\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Panel2Patch\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u6570\u636e\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "Panel2Patch\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u914d\u5bf9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u540c\u6b65\u4e14\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u5171\u8bed\u624b\u52bf\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u62fc\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u97f3-\u624b\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u4e00\u4e00\u6620\u5c04\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u540c\u6b65\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u5747\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u624b\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4ece\u97f3\u9891\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e30\u5bcc\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u4e2d\u9009\u53d6\u5168\u7403\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u62fc\u63a5\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u97f3\u9891\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4ee5\u5f80\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u62fc\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u624b\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.\n  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models.

To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation.

To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings.

It contains over 440,000 facial trajectories in total, among which more than 52,000 are longer than 10 frames, including 68 manually reviewed trajectories that span the entire 150 frames. To the best of our knowledge, PoreTrack3D is the first benchmark dataset to capture both traditional facial landmarks and pore-scale keypoints trajectory, advancing the study of fine-grained facial expressions through the analysis of subtle skin-surface motion. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting methods on PoreTrack3D, establishing the first performance baseline in this domain. Overall, the pipeline developed for this benchmark dataset's creation establishes a new framework for high-fidelity facial motion capture and dynamic 3D reconstruction.

Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision.

However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation.

To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model.

However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects.

Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation.

However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF.

However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment.

Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684VLM\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8token\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86token\u95f4\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u526a\u679d\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u590d\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684token\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u91ca\u653e\u3002\u7a7a\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVLM-Pruner\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684token\u526a\u679d\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u79bb\u5fc3\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7531\u8fd1\u53ca\u8fdc\u7684token\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4fdd\u7559\u76ee\u6807\u7269\u4f53\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2) \u7a7a\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u7f13\u51b2\uff08BSS\uff09\u51c6\u5219\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bbtoken\u7684\u9009\u53d6\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u6563\uff1b3) \u5e76\u884c\u8d2a\u5fc3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u526a\u679d\uff1b4) \u9488\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u88ab\u526a\u9664token\u4e2d\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u878d\u5408\u8fdb\u4fdd\u7559token\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41VLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0cVLM-Pruner\u572888.9%\u7684\u9ad8\u526a\u679d\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e3b\u6d41\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM-Pruner\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884ctoken\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e0e\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research.\n  The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK.

However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGeoViS\u7684\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5956\u52b1\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u76ee\u6807\u8fc7\u5c0f\u3001\u573a\u666f\u8303\u56f4\u5927\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GeoViS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9010\u6b65\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0cGeoViS\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u628a\u63e1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cGeoViS\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoViS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9488\u5bf9\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u666f\u6574\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9065\u611f\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Project page: https://tkhkaeio.github.io/projects/25-dfmamba/index.html", "summary": "Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDF-Mamba\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e25\u91cd\u906e\u6321\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8eResNet\u8fd9\u7c7bCNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u906e\u6321\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff08Mamba\uff09\u7684DF-Mamba\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u72b6\u6001\u626b\u63cf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u5377\u79ef\u540e\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u8054\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6db5\u76d6\u5355\u624b\u3001\u53cc\u624b\u3001\u624b\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001RGB\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0cDF-Mamba\u5728\u5168\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5982VMamba\u3001Spatial-Mamba\uff09\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1ResNet-50\u3002", "conclusion": "DF-Mamba\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively.

Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6AttMetNet\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u54e8\u51752\u53f7\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7532\u70f7\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u6548\u6e29\u5ba4\u6c14\u4f53\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5176\u6392\u653e\u5bf9\u6c14\u5019\u53d8\u5316\u5e94\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u4f46\u7528\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u65f6\uff0c\u80cc\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5730\u8868\u7c7b\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u865a\u8b66\u8f83\u591a\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u73b0\u6709CNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e9f\u9700\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AttMetNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u7532\u70f7\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\u6307\u6570\uff08NDMI\uff09\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u578bU-Net\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u7532\u70f7\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7fbd\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b63\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u6781\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165focal loss\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cAttMetNet\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fd1\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387-\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u548cIoU\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "AttMetNet\u9996\u6b21\u5c06NDMI\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e13\u4e3a\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u7532\u70f7\u7fbd\u6d41\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7532\u70f7\u6392\u653e\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Accepted to AAAI-26 (Main Technical Track)", "summary": "Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations.

However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TrackNetV5\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ec6\u5316\u5934\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u4f53\u80b2\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u7403\uff09\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u906e\u6321\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u4e1a\u754c\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709TrackNet\u7cfb\u5217\u5728\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5feb\u901f\u5c0f\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46V1-V3\u7248\u672c\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0cV4\u867d\u7136\u5f15\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u5374\u4e0d\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6a21\u7cca\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u8db3\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8ffd\u8e2a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "TrackNetV5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u89e3\u8026(MDD)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5e26\u7b26\u53f7\u6781\u6027\u573a\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d1\u751f\u548c\u65b9\u5411\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ec6\u5316(R-STR)\u5934\uff0c\u5728\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0b\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6b8b\u5dee\u4fe1\u606f\u6821\u6b63\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728TrackNetV2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTrackNetV5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86F1\u5206\u65700.9859\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u73870.9733\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u524d\u4ee3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4ec5\u5e26\u67653.7%\u7684FLOPs\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "TrackNetV5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8ffd\u8e2a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5411\u68c0\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u8f7b\u5fae\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u4e1a\u754c\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u7684\u4f53\u80b2\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage.

The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks.

Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments.

While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u5229\u7528\u5355\u5e27\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5305\u62ecRGB\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u5883\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u5224\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6bd4\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u5224\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u6709\u65f6\u4ec5\u51ed\u5355\u5e27\u573a\u666f\u548c\u8bed\u5883\u5c31\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u60f3\u63a2\u7d22\u673a\u5668\u662f\u5426\u4e5f\u80fd\u7528\u5355\u5e27\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6216\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u5224\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AAG\uff08Action Anticipation at a Glimpse\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u5e27\u7684RGB\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5148\u524d\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u6216\u5355\u5e27\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u83b7\u53d6\u3002\u8be5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u5e27\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u5224\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728IKEA-ASM\u3001Meccano\u548cAssembly101\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u6027\u6d3b\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAAG\u7684\u5355\u5e27\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u5224\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b8c\u6574\u89c6\u9891\u805a\u5408\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u540c\u7c7bSOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u5355\u5e27\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u5224\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u4f4e\u65f6\u5ef6\u573a\u666f\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

A Cross-Generator Study", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift.

We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics.

It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation.

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks.

Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u7247\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5MRD\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u56fe\u7247\u88c1\u526a\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u88c2\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u7247\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u88c1\u526a\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u88ab\u5207\u5206\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMRD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u56fe\u7247\u8fdb\u884c\u88c1\u526a\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bed\u4e49\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u8868\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6ed1\u7a97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u8303\u56f4\u76f4\u63a5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u7247\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MRD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MRD\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u7247\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u88c2\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDiverseAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f29\u653elogits\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd4\u7279\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5c16\u9510\u7684logits\u5206\u5e03\u9020\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DiverseAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94logits\u5206\u5e03\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9510\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u52a0\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u5206\u5e03\u5e73\u6ed1\u5e26\u6765\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u91c7\u6837\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6token\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDiverseAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DiverseAR\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6bd4\u7279\u7ea7AR\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u51fa\u3002"}}

However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field.

Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6InEx\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u81ea\u4e3b\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5185\u7701\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5e38\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u6216\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u63d0\u51faInEx\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u503c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5185\u7701\u63a8\u7406\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u521d\u6b65\u7b54\u6848\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u4f5c\u6821\u9a8c\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6cdb\u7528\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cInEx\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f974%\u523027%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "InEx\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95ee\u7b54\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos.

We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \\textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed.

The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Sync-LoRA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7f16\u8f91\u4eba\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7f16\u8f91\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9010\u5e27\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u7075\u6d3b\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u5916\u89c2\u3001\u8868\u60c5\u3001\u6dfb\u52a0\u7269\u4f53\uff09\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5e8f\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u540c\u6b65\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u539f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u5e27\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e27\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u518d\u5c06\u4fee\u6539\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u6574\u6bb5\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LoRA\uff08\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u6743\u91cd\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f46\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u65f6\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u7f16\u8f91\u540c\u6b65\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "Sync-LoRA\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5916\u89c2\u4fee\u6539\u3001\u6dfb\u52a0\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u66f4\u6362\u80cc\u666f\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4eba\u8138\u8eab\u4efd\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "Sync-LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u540c\u6b65\u4fdd\u6301\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+).

Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6d41\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08Flow ODE\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u578bMRI\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "MRI\u6210\u50cf\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u8f6f\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4e14\u65e0\u7535\u79bb\u8f90\u5c04\uff0c\u4f46\u91c7\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8f83\u6162\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684Unrolled\u7f51\u7edc\u5b58\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Unrolled\u7f51\u7edc\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u6d41ODE\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u636e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdFlow-Aligned Training\uff08FLAT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ODE\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u63a8\u5bfc\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3ODE\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0FLAT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b1/3\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eUnrolled\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FLAT\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0eUnrolled\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53ef\u4e3aMRI\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65b0\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MAViD\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5de5\u660e\u786e\u7684Conductor-Creator\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52-\u6269\u6563\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u975e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53d7\u9650\u3001\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u97f3\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u65e0\u7f1d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u6df1\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faConductor-Creator\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff1aConductor\u8d1f\u8d23\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5c06\u6307\u4ee4\u5206\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e0e\u8bed\u97f3\u7ec4\u6210\u4ee5\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0cCreator\u6839\u636e\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u56de\u590d\u3002Creator\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u751f\u6210\u97f3\u9891\uff09\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\uff09\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u751f\u52a8\u4e14\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "MAViD\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency.

However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist.

In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCAMEO\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u83b7\u5f97\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51faCAMEO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u65bd\u52a0\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u52a0\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u5373\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "CAMEO\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff08\u6536\u655b\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u51cf\u534a\uff09\u548c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cCAMEO\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "CAMEO\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4e2d\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.", "AI": {"tldr": "MagicQuill V2\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u5f62\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u62c6\u5206\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a(\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd)\u96be\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u7528\u6237\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u521b\u4f5c\u610f\u56fe\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u521b\u5efa\u4ec0\u4e48\uff09\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u653e\u5728\u54ea\uff09\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5f62\u72b6\u5982\u4f55\uff09\u3001\u989c\u8272\uff08\u7528\u4ec0\u4e48\u8272\u5f69\uff09\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5c42\u3002\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u5185\u5bb9\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u652f\u7528\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u5206\u5c42\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u4f7f\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u76f4\u89c2\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "MagicQuill V2\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u521b\u4f5c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}
