While\nrecent dictionary learning methods such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) provide a\npromising route to discover human-interpretable features, they suffer from a\nvariety of problems, including a systematic failure to capture the rich\nconceptual information that drives linguistic understanding. Instead, they\nexhibit a bias towards shallow, token-specific, or noisy features, such as \"the\nphrase 'The' at the start of sentences\". In this work, we propose that this is\ndue to a fundamental issue with how dictionary learning methods for LLMs are\ntrained. Language itself has a rich, well-studied structure spanning syntax,\nsemantics, and pragmatics; however, current unsupervised methods largely ignore\nthis linguistic knowledge, leading to poor feature discovery that favors\nsuperficial patterns over meaningful concepts. We focus on a simple but\nimportant aspect of language: semantic content has long-range dependencies and\ntends to be smooth over a sequence, whereas syntactic information is much more\nlocal. Building on this insight, we introduce Temporal Sparse Autoencoders\n(T-SAEs), which incorporate a novel contrastive loss encouraging consistent\nactivations of high-level features over adjacent tokens. This simple yet\npowerful modification enables SAEs to disentangle semantic from syntactic\nfeatures in a self-supervised manner. Across multiple datasets and models,\nT-SAEs recover smoother, more coherent semantic concepts without sacrificing\nreconstruction quality. Strikingly, they exhibit clear semantic structure\ndespite being trained without explicit semantic signal, offering a new pathway\nfor unsupervised interpretability in language models."}

Particularly, NILC follows an iterative workflow, in which clustering\nassignments are judiciously updated by carefully refining cluster centroids and\ntext embeddings of uncertain utterances with the aid of large language models\n(LLMs). Specifically, NILC first taps into LLMs to create additional semantic\ncentroids for clusters, thereby enriching the contextual semantics of the\nEuclidean centroids of embeddings. Moreover, LLMs are then harnessed to augment\nhard samples (ambiguous or terse utterances) identified from clusters via\nrewriting for subsequent cluster correction. Further, we inject supervision\nsignals through non-trivial techniques seeding and soft must links for more\naccurate NID in the semi-supervised setting. Extensive experiments comparing\nNILC against multiple recent baselines under both unsupervised and\nsemi-supervised settings showcase that NILC can achieve significant performance\nimprovements over six benchmark datasets of diverse domains consistently."}

This gap stems partly from the lack of\neasy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational\ncost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy\nlearning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy\nlearning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of\nchoice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator\ncapable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further\nintroduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint\nposition control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective\nmeans of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of\nimplicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive\ncomparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most\nwidely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping,\nparallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for\nnon-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a\ncomprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and\nevaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a\nrare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy."}

To address this, we propose a\nnovel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for\nprecise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast\ninference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ\ndata-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank\nsubspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is\nrobust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a\nspecialized recovery method based on an $\\ell_1$-norm formulation, which\naccurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors.\nBy exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our\nmethod achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the\ntriple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse\nbranch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an\nultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense\nbranch provides rich parallel supervision.

CGCE uses a\nlightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then\nrefine prompts containing undesired concepts.

Recent test-time methods leverage\ntextual feedback to overcome this, but they often critique and revise a single\ncandidate response, lacking a principled mechanism to systematically analyze,\nweigh, and synthesize the strengths of multiple promising candidates. Such a\nmechanism is crucial because different responses may excel in distinct aspects\n(e.g., clarity, factual accuracy, or tone), and combining their best elements\nmay produce a far superior outcome. This paper proposes the Textual\nSelf-Attention Network (TSAN), a new paradigm for test-time preference\noptimization that requires no parameter updates. TSAN emulates self-attention\nentirely in natural language to overcome this gap: it analyzes multiple\ncandidates by formatting them into textual keys and values, weighs their\nrelevance using an LLM-based attention module, and synthesizes their strengths\ninto a new, preference-aligned response under the guidance of the learned\ntextual attention. This entire process operates in a textual gradient space,\nenabling iterative and interpretable optimization.

Results: A\ntotal of 1,448 female patients (mean age, 49 +/- 12 years) were included.\nT1sub+T2w achieved an AUC of 0.77 +/- 0.04; DWI1500+T2w, 0.74 +/- 0.04\n(p=0.15). At 97.5% sensitivity, T1sub+T2w had the highest specificity (19% +/-\n7%), followed by DWI1500+T2w (17% +/- 11%). Missed lesions had a mean diameter\n<10 mm at 95% and 97.5% thresholds for both T1sub and DWI1500, predominantly\nnon-mass enhancements. External validation yielded an AUC of 0.77, with 88% of\nattention maps rated good or moderate.

This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved\noverwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in\ntransformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated\naggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain\nrobust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce\nsome learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens\nbefore a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly\nprocessed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism,\nimplicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the\naggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the\nlast output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although\nimplicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely\nsimple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the\ninitialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration.\nTo this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token\ninitialization method derived from empirical studies.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nreal-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery\nwithout downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each\nimage into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and\ndynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse,\nglobally available digital surface model (DSM).

Despite recent advances in 3D urban modeling, most\nlearning-based models are trained on building datasets with limited\narchitectural diversity, which significantly undermines their generalizability\nacross heterogeneous urban environments. To address this limitation, we present\nBuildingWorld, a comprehensive and structured 3D building dataset designed to\nbridge the gap in stylistic diversity.

Specifically, BuildingWorld\nprovides about five million LOD2 building models collected from diverse\nsources, accompanied by real and simulated airborne LiDAR point clouds. This\nenables comprehensive research on 3D building reconstruction, detection and\nsegmentation. Cyber City, a virtual city model, is introduced to enable the\ngeneration of unlimited training data with customized and structurally diverse\npoint cloud distributions.

(2) Suboptimal post-training paradigms that fail to jointly\noptimize perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we propose\ntwo novel difficulty-aware sampling strategies: Progressive Image Semantic\nMasking (PISM) quantifies sample hardness through systematic image degradation,\nwhile Cross-Modality Attention Balance (CMAB) assesses cross-modal interaction\ncomplexity via attention distribution analysis. Leveraging these metrics, we\ndesign a hierarchical training framework that incorporates both GRPO-only and\nSFT+GRPO hybrid training paradigms, and evaluate them across six benchmark\ndatasets. Experiments demonstrate consistent superiority of GRPO applied to\ndifficulty-stratified samples compared to conventional SFT+GRPO pipelines,\nindicating that strategic data sampling can obviate the need for supervised\nfine-tuning while improving model accuracy.

We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon\nthrough a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics\",\ncombining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and\nactivation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a\ndistinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression\nfollowed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in\nfeature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between\nteacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that\nteacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in\nlater layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited\nchannel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively\nharm student performance.

FreqCert first transforms the input\npoint cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured\nfrequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each\nsub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final\nprediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are\nconstructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making\nthe partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the\nobject's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the\ncertified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and\ninterpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency\ndomain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN\ndatasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified\naccuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations. Our results suggest\nthat spectral representations provide an effective pathway toward certifiable\nrobustness in 3D point cloud recognition."}

We introduce Generative\nClean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to\nidentify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and\nstealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign\ntask-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an\nextremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than\n1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully\nadapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the\nfirst demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation.\nGCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses."}

To address these limitations, we introduce\nSpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial\ngrounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial\nperception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial\nrelations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards.\nSpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline\nthat generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL\nwith a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding.\nSpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline\non spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the\nbase-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results\nshowcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned\nreasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and\nadvancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning."}

The core idea of our work is\nto leverage the rich priors in well-trained video models to extract the common\nmotion patterns and then embed them into a shared low-dimensional latent space.\nSpecifically, we first generate multiple videos of the same object with diverse\nmotions. We then embed each motion into a latent vector and train a shared\nmotion decoder to learn the distribution of motions represented by a structured\nand compact motion representation, i.e., neural key point trajectories. The\ncanonical 3D Gaussians are then driven by these key points and fused to model\nthe geometry and appearance. During inference time with learned latent space,\nwe can instantly sample diverse 3D motions in a single-forward pass and support\nseveral interesting applications including 3D motion interpolation and\nlanguage-guided motion generation.

However,\nsafety regulations and operational constraints in operating rooms (ORs) limit\nembodied agents from freely perceiving and interacting in realistic settings.\nDigital twins provide high-fidelity, risk-free environments for exploration and\ntraining. How we may create photorealistic and dynamic digital representations\nof ORs that capture relevant spatial, visual, and behavioral complexity remains\nunclear. We introduce TwinOR, a framework for constructing photorealistic,\ndynamic digital twins of ORs for embodied AI research. The system reconstructs\nstatic geometry from pre-scan videos and continuously models human and\nequipment motion through multi-view perception of OR activities. The static and\ndynamic components are fused into an immersive 3D environment that supports\ncontrollable simulation and embodied exploration. The proposed framework\nreconstructs complete OR geometry with centimeter level accuracy while\npreserving dynamic interaction across surgical workflows, enabling realistic\nrenderings and a virtual playground for embodied AI systems. In our\nexperiments, TwinOR simulates stereo and monocular sensor streams for geometry\nunderstanding and visual localization tasks. Models such as FoundationStereo\nand ORB-SLAM3 on TwinOR-synthesized data achieve performance within their\nreported accuracy on real indoor datasets, demonstrating that TwinOR provides\nsensor-level realism sufficient for perception and localization challenges. By\nestablishing a real-to-sim pipeline for constructing dynamic, photorealistic\ndigital twins of OR environments, TwinOR enables the safe, scalable, and\ndata-efficient development and benchmarking of embodied AI, ultimately\naccelerating the deployment of embodied AI from sim-to-real."}

The ability to perceive, track, and manipulate\nthese objects without prior knowledge of their geometry or kinematic properties\nremains a fundamental challenge in robotics. In this work, we present a novel\nmethod for visuo-tactile-based tracking of unseen objects (single, multiple, or\narticulated) during robotic interaction without assuming any prior knowledge\nregarding object shape or dynamics. Our novel pose tracking approach termed\nArtReg (stands for Articulated Registration) integrates visuo-tactile point\nclouds in an unscented Kalman Filter formulation in the SE(3) Lie Group for\npoint cloud registration. ArtReg is used to detect possible articulated joints\nin objects using purposeful manipulation maneuvers such as pushing or\nhold-pulling with a two-robot team. Furthermore, we leverage ArtReg to develop\na closed-loop controller for goal-driven manipulation of articulated objects to\nmove the object into the desired pose configuration. We have extensively\nevaluated our approach on various types of unknown objects through real robot\nexperiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of our method by evaluating\nobjects with varying center of mass, low-light conditions, and with challenging\nvisual backgrounds. Furthermore, we benchmarked our approach on a standard\ndataset of articulated objects and demonstrated improved performance in terms\nof pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments indicate\nthat robust and accurate pose tracking leveraging visuo-tactile information\nenables robots to perceive and interact with unseen complex articulated objects\n(with revolute or prismatic joints)."}

Detecting and\nmitigating hallucinations is challenging when ground-truth references are\nunavailable and model internals are inaccessible. This paper proposes a novel\nself-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate\ncaptions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using\nonly the captions themselves without requiring external references or model\naccess. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a\nlow-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual\nmagnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the\nmost hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that\nour approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free\ncaptions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a\n6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by\nsparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of\nhallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism. Additionally, our method,\nwhich can be easily parallelized, reduces inference time by 51-67% compared to\ndebate approaches, making it practical for real-time autonomous driving\napplications."}

Accepted by IROS 2025", "summary": "Efficient, accurate, and flexible relative localization is crucial in\nair-ground collaborative tasks. However, current approaches for robot relative\nlocalization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM\nsystems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the\nstate estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this\nend, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to\nintegrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground\nrelative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep\nlearning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative\nlocalization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local\nBundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain\naccurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint\noptimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses\ninterpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the\nrelative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an\nincremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based\ndescriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both\naccuracy and efficiency. Unlike traditional multi-robot SLAM approaches that\ntransmit images or point clouds, our method only transmits keypoint pixels and\ntheir descriptors, effectively constraining the communication bandwidth under\n0.3 Mbps.

Our\ncontributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained\nbenchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in\nrobotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric\nannotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well\nas instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable\nvisuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based\nframework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding.\nIt uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object\nrepresentations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant\nembeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into\nexecutable actions.
